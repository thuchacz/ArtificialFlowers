<lb/>Note if you see that the dye is too thick
<lb/>with a glass of hide glue; one needs to take
<lb/>more still, all until such time that the soup is good ◆
<lb/>Note when you would like to make less a dont [which?] one needs to 
<lb/>take some vermillion, and some mien [mine?] to your liking,
<lb/>and mix them well in hide glue; next take all at 
<lb/>once that which you have prepared for dyeing; and throw it right away 
<lb/>into the glue, or otherwise said in the soup; one needs to rub it very little,
<lb/>but instead of this, one needs to press it very well, and 
<lb/>put it back, and open it up; and after that press it again, and put it back,
<lb/>all until such time that the dye is well penetrated in 
<lb/>the cambric; in the end, if you see that you have too much
<lb/>soup, or that the cambric is too wetted, one needs to put
<lb/>still more pieces of cambric inside, so well that you 
<lb/>should not have to press anything out; one still needs to press it all 
<lb/>together; so that it penetrates in the dye also;
<lb/>But if you see to the contrary, that you do not have 
<lb/>enough glue and dye for the quantity that you have
<lb/>started to dye; a dons [then?], one needs to take all of the fabric out,
<lb/>next pour the glue, in the saucer; and one needs to mix 
<lb/>in still more dye, after that throw it the mass inside;
<lb/>and do as here before; but the glue, and the cambric, must be hot
