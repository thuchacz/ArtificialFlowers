<lb/>Way to green the stems of flowers,
<lb/>one puts in a dish, a good spoon
<lb/>of little white, like the painter +uses, for the firstcolor + that one mixes with
<lb/>clear/white gum, for this end, one ~
<lb/>puts it to soak five or six days in advance, a
<lb/>large handful of gum, as much as one can hold in one hand, better more, than less;
<lb/>before mixing the little white one passes
<lb/>the gum, through a very white cloth, like
<lb/>I said for the green, next one mixes with,
<lb/>two, or three spoons, of very white gamboge,
<lb/>then one pours the green on top, and the
<lb/>rest of the gum also, but when the thick
<lb/>green, is not sufficient, to green well, one
<lb/>pours some green from the bottle; until such time
<lb/>that the whole is just as you wish, next
<lb/>one leaves it to become thick like pap,
<lb/>stirring it two, or three times, each day,
<lb/>this having been done; one applies it on the stems
<lb/>of flowers, with a paintbrush, the stems being
<lb/>dry, if they are not even, one paints them
<lb/>with the paintbrush, once more, and that
<lb/>several times, if there is need. but once is best;
<lb/>and if the stems do not shine
<lb/>enough at all to your
<lb/>wishes one needs to pass over with the paintbrush of egg white, well beaten; ~~~
<lb/>One does the same way, for the stems of
<lb/>carnations, and that without using gamboge,
