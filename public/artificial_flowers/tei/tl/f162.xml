<lb/>into which one adds more sap green still.
<lb/>note that the paper you use for this
<lb/>must be fine and [gesloten = dense, perhaps?],
<lb/>and must be coated with
<lb/>warm white starch on one side,
<lb/>and not thick, and the starch should be
<lb/>[made] very even in color with a
<lb/>soft brush. then hang it to dry,
<lb/>and when it is fully dry, lay it down
<lb/>[passen = to fit] so it becomes smooth.
<lb/>then take your green paint, and
<lb/>a part of a sponge
<lb/>to color your paper with,
<lb/>first on the starched side and then
<lb/>[maer naer den eersten en 2 keer = after the first 2 more times].
<lb/>This must be done with a light hand
<lb/>and sparingly so it does not flow, [als = when ]
<lb/>you have gone over your sheet of paper with a light hand,
<lb/>[sijnde = if ] there are still
<lb/>streaks you have missed,
<lb/>they should no longer be there.
