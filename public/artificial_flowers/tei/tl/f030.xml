<lb/>and printing parchment, is the month of
<lb/>May, or just as well the start of the month of
<lb/>June, and like [this] too, the start of the month of + August and
<lb/>of September, also for making velum green,
<lb/>or otherwise said, parchment. ~~
<lb/>Way to wash the velum. One needs to
<lb/>put to soak in the evening, and the next day, one
<lb/>washes it, as one washes the laundry, piece by piece,
<lb/>in rain water or fountain water, entirely
<lb/>cold, without ever heating it. Nor
<lb/>for the soaking, because the velum or parchment,
<lb/>will become as easy to tear
<lb/>as paper in heating the water. One washes it
<lb/>in this way, twice a day, changing
<lb/>the water each time, and this thusly eight days in
<lb/>a row. But when the parchment is written [upon] with
<lb/>red letters, one needs to scrape the said letter. After ~
<lb/>having washed the parchment, two or three days, one
<lb/>takes it out of the water, and one spreads it out on a
<lb/>very smooth board, all wet like it is, one scrapes the
<lb/>red letters with the sharp edge of a pen-knife or a knife,
<lb/>grating [it]. One needs to hold one's hand very lightly, and
<lb/>turn the parchment on both sides. If there are ~
<lb/>red letters there too, one needs to scrape so well that one
<lb/>cannot see anything of the red, because the green doesn't have enough strength
<lb/>to cover the red, nor musical notes,
<lb/>as it is not appropriate for making green. . ~~~
