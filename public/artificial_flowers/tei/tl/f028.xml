<lb/>for otherwise it is not necessary to put it
<lb/>in the vinegar, because the soup, is sour from the
<lb/>first cambric, then one washes again another 
<lb/>piece, if one sees that the soup is giving color
<lb/>still, then one does, as here before, this cambric
<lb/>must be kept from the elements, because the color
<lb/>is not so pure as the first, and it sticks
<lb/>to itself, ~~~  Note; when one wants
<lb/>to have very red cambrics, one needs to rinse them, only
<lb/>in three terrines of water ◆
<lb/>Note, one pound of safflower, for one 
<lb/>pound of cambric makes a beautiful color; but
<lb/>one ounce, or an ounce and a half less, makes a
<lb/>more beautiful color; and when one wants to have
<lb/>several red brown colors; one needs to divide
<lb/>the soup, in three parts; and take
<lb/>some cambric as you wish, one time
<lb/>a little more, and the other time a little 
<lb/>less; and hauling it up such that you see that the
<lb/>color is as one wants to have it, ~~~
<lb/> that which follows is to make, several pale colors
<lb/>for pinks &amp;c. ~~ 
<lb/>After the first cambric is rinsed,
<lb/>one takes, two, or three pieces of cambric, or of ~
<lb/>muslin, all dry, and very white,
<lb/>without putting it in the vinegar; and one washes it
<lb/>all immediately in :+: :+:: the verjus, then one presses it outside, and one throws it in:+: the first rinse, one 
<lb/>washes it also + + a long time, that it becomes red, next one
<lb/>washes it strongly also, in the three other rinses, in
