<lb/>Way to dye paper red
<lb/>Put an ounce of potash in
<lb/>an earthenware pot, then boil
<lb/>a stoop of rainwater and
<lb/>pour it, all boiling, on the
<lb/>potash, let it stand
<lb/>untouched until the next day. Then
<lb/>gently, without stirring, pour the clear
<lb/>lye out into another 
<lb/>clean pot. Then take a kanne
<lb/>of this lye, set it to boil
<lb/>and take a pound of red cloth
<lb/>put this in a clean pot and once
<lb/>the lye has boiled, pour it on the
<lb/>cloth, let it somewhat trecken
<lb/>on the fire, turning the cloth
<lb/>from time to time. Once it is all well
<lb/>drunken through, take remove it [from the fire]
<lb/>and let it stand to cool some
<lb/>then put the other kanne of lye
<lb/>on the fire. Let it boil. Then squeeze out
<lb/>the cloth as tightly as you
<lb/>can, and while the lye boils, put
<lb/>the cloth in it. Turn 
<lb/>and stir it well. Let [it] boil for a quarter
<lb/>of an hour. Then let it cool
<lb/>a bit. Squeeze it out again.
<lb/>Then, add all the soup and
<lb/>place this on the fire. Put
<lb/>a susijn of white alum in it.
<lb/>Let this boil a bit. The foam
<lb/>must not be thrown
<lb/>away since good dye can
<lb/>come from it. Then put a bit of
<lb/>white tartar in a pot
<lb/>and pour the boiling dye on top of it.
<lb/>If you see that there is still foam
<lb/>forming, take it off, and and
<lb/>do not put it with the other foam. Then
<lb/>let it sit for two or three days
<lb/>without stirring. Then gently pour
<lb/>all the dye off, and see if the
<lb/>sediment is dirty or if there are black
<lb/>bits in it. If there are any in it, then
<lb/>it isn’t good. If the sediment is clean,
<lb/>put it in with the dye. Then place
<lb/>it again on the fire. If it is
<lb/>purple, it is that there is not enough
<lb/>tartar in it. Also, if there is
<lb/>too much tartar in it, it is
<lb/>too pale. Then put some starch
<lb/>dust-bloom?? in a pot, crush
