<lb/>Mr Joris, druggist, sells brazilwood
<lb/>wood that is very good for painting
<lb/>paper red. One does this as follows:
<lb/>for two stuivers’s or five’s worth of
<lb/>this wood according to the puddle that one wants
<lb/>to make. And for the nicest, take but
<lb/>a half of it. And put it in a pot with
<lb/>a can or three pints of rainwater.
<lb/>Let it extract somewhat and then cook[boil?] it for half an hour
<lb/>or somewhat more. Then a piece of red alum,
<lb/>finely pounded, but one must first, in a dish or pan,
<lb/>smilten[melt?] [it] on its own. But one must understand that this does not
<lb/>appear red but is white, but it is so named. And with
<lb/>the outside also cooked, while the wood has simmered
<lb/>for so long, then you pour the soup of alum in the
<lb/>first pot and stir it around with a stocktien. Then the
<lb/>whole thing becomes red. And let it simmer together somewhat, then pour some
<lb/>soup in a little pot. And once it is cool, take white paper and lay it on
