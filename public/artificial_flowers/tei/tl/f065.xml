<lb/>one needs to leave it to fall again to the
<lb/>bottom, from there to throw all the water away; this
<lb/>blue can be used again, as before;
<lb/>Note that one never undyes this blue
<lb/>cambric unless one sees that the cambric
<lb/>is too thick to use, because the color
<lb/>is always good, this is why one needs
<lb/>always to take fine cambric, the ~
<lb/>first time, because the blue fattens
<lb/>the stuffs, but when one is forced to
<lb/>undye it, one needs to undy the pale blue
<lb/>alone, and the brown blue alone, in order to
<lb/>make use again of these blues like the
<lb/>first time. ~~~
<lb/>Way for making vine ashes
<lb/>when one cuts the vine one needs to
<lb/>gather up all of the cut wood. One needs to put it
<lb/>to burn in a chimney, or in an oven,
<lb/>very tidy, without wood, and without ashes of
<lb/>other sorts of wood, the vine wood being ~
<lb/>all burnt, one needs to take all the fire, and ~
<lb/>ashes, in a nasty pot, that is worth
