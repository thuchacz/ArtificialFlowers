<lb/>nothing, to be used for another thing, next
<lb/>one needs to keep stoking it, from time,
<lb/>to time, until such time, that the whole, is consumed
<lb/>into ash. ~~~
<lb/>Way for making lye of ~
<lb/>vine ash, one needs to take three
<lb/>double handfuls of ash, with
<lb/>seven or eight pints of rain, or fountain,
<lb/>water, one needs to leave it to boil, until
<lb/>[it reduces to] four, or five pints, all the more,
<lb/>if one boils them in a marmite + + well covered, one must,
<lb/>as soon as the marmite is removed from the fire,
<lb/>pour it into an earthenware pot, very
<lb/>tidy, and having been used for anything else,
<lb/>other than for dyeing pink, one needs
<lb/>to leave the ashes at the bottom of the marmite,
<lb/>as much as one can, next the next day,
<lb/>one needs to pass the lye through a
<lb/>linen cloth, into another pot, pouring
<lb/>it all gently, without moving the ash,
<lb/>which are at the bottom of the pot, from there, one
<lb/>can use it, for all that one 
<lb/>wants to make, with the said lye. ~~
