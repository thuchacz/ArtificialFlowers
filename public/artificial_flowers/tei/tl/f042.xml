<lb/>For making paper yellow, one takes the
<lb/>size of two, or three big nuts, of
<lb/>gamboge that one puts to soak in a little
<lb/>pot with fountain, or rain, water ~
<lb/>and that [is] the quantity for covering in yellow
<lb/>well, and a bit on top [of that]; one puts there also
<lb/>to soak for five, or six liards, of saffron,
<lb/>whole, without being pestled, being well soaked
<lb/>one could boil it if one wanted, next
<lb/>one pours a little of this soup, in the
<lb/>gamboge, which one mixes well together; from there
<lb/>one yellows the paper, but if one sees that the ~
<lb/>paper is not beautiful, or high yellow enough, one ~
<lb/>there pours again some saffron soup, until such
<lb/>time as, that the whole is to your liking, but
<lb/>when the soup is too thick, one needs to put there
<lb/>a little more water, the paper yellowed two
<lb/>times, on each side, when the colors are good;
<lb/>makes a very beautiful paper,
<lb/>and even once also; ~
<lb/>note that the egg white must
<lb/>be well beaten before
<lb/>you use it; ~
<lb/>Way for accommodating dye, for 
<lb/>painting flowers on paper, gamboge ~
<lb/>mixes itself, and one puts it to soak in the same
<lb/>way, as I said here before, but instead of
<lb/>taking so large a quantity of gamboge, one
<lb/>only puts to soak the size of one + big nut; and
<lb/>water. In hauling it out; next one traces with the
<lb/>paintbrush, without the use of saffron. ~
