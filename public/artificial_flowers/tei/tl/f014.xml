<lb/>The blue for flowers, which one calls
<lb/>areniez, is made with English ash, 
<lb/>in the same manner as the starch blue, 
<lb/>but the blue of English ash does not 
<lb/>have to be rubbed into the toile as strongly as the 
<lb/>starch blue, because the color is finer
<lb/>and it suffices, that the cambric has the color of 
<lb/>this blue, ~~~
<lb/>For making red ones one needs to take
<lb/>some vermillion, and hide glue,;
<lb/>the toiles being cut, in leaves, one needs to put a 
<lb/>clear carmine on top,: fish glue is
<lb/>also good, but with hide glue, the carmine
<lb/>is easier to trace, one needs to rub the cambric
<lb/>in the said soup, as you did
<lb/>with the English ash, this toile is useful 
<lb/>for making ranunculus, allimone, and Constantinople tulip ~~~
<lb/>The green toiles are made with hide glue,
<lb/>and some green from the bottle, without white
<lb/>starch; fish glue is also good,
<lb/>but dried cambric, one needs to plunge it 
<lb/>again into this glue because
<lb/>the green thins it too much, but hide glue
