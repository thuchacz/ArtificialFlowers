<lb/>sieve, this being done, before putting it into the
<lb/>soup; the verdigris, being well mixed ~
<lb/>and stirred in the said soup one puts it three
<lb/>or four hours in the sun, next ~
<lb/>one takes a little piece of sponge, and one ~
<lb/>greens the paper in the same way, as
<lb/>the preceding green. one needs to move the bottom, from time,
<lb/>note: if there is no sun, one skips this step; to time. ~
<lb/>Red paper is made in the same way
<lb/>also, one takes clear gum, with a
<lb/>little + half packet of vermillion, that one mixes well
<lb/>together, the vermillion being well mixed, one
<lb/>pours once more a little half spoon, of the
<lb/>said gum, with two or three spoonfuls of water,
<lb/>one needs to stir the whole together well, next
<lb/>one leaves it like that, two, or three hours
<lb/>more, or less, before using it, ✠ then
<lb/>one reddens the paper with it, one needs to move the
<lb/>bottom, before reddening, and the second time that
<lb/>one reddens the paper, one needs to pass the sponge
<lb/>very lightly, and do one's [best] possible in order that
<lb/>the paper will be beautiful red enough, being reddened
<lb/>twice on each side,. one passes over it also,
<lb/>twice on each side, egg white, very 
<lb/>lightly ; But for green paper ; and yellow, etc.
<lb/>It suffices to pass over, with the egg ~
<lb/>white, on each side, once. ~~~
