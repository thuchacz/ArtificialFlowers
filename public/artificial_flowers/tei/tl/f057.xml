<lb/>to soak a little, after that one needs to make it boil, and
<lb/>when the dye starts to boil;
<lb/>being a little boiled, one takes it out
<lb/>of the dye, and one does as I 
<lb/>said here before, about brown yellow, jonquil ~~~
<lb/>Cloth that one dyes yellow like
<lb/>silk, at the last rinse, after having
<lb/>pressed the water out well, one can put them in
<lb/>verjus, if one wants, and if one sees that
<lb/>the color is more beautiful to one's liking, also
<lb/>the verjus, one can continue that, each
<lb/>time that one dyes, but if one sees that the
<lb/>color is not more beautiful with the verjus, it
<lb/>is not necessary to use it, because the
<lb/>cambric is in peril of sticking to itself [of staining itself??], and of
<lb/>changing color, next one dries
<lb/>it, being dry, one stiffens it with 
<lb/>fish glue, and just as well with
<lb/>hide glue, if it is for making flowers;
<lb/>being dry, one irons it with the hands
<lb/>only; if not, one needs to iron it like
<lb/>silk. ~~~
<lb/>Cloth that one dyes yellow like silk; being
<lb/>soaked a half hour, or three quarters of an hour; being well boiled,
<lb/>and the color to your liking; one needs to press the dye out well,
<lb/>next one needs to open it up well, and plunge it into the verjus, if
<lb/>you find it good; then press the verjus out well, and
<lb/>throw it also into the soapy wash of white soap; being well
<lb/>washed to your liking, one needs to rinse it in two, or three,
<lb/>other rain, or fountain, waters, at the last, one
<lb/>needs to press out the water well; then one hangs it in the attic
<lb/>with the window closed; being dry; one plunges them,
<lb/>and stiffens [them] in the hide glue; but one does not need
<lb/>to press the glue, as strongly as the water; but the cambric etc.
<lb/>must be a little well wet; as I said here before,
<lb/>then one hangs it again once more in the attic, with the
<lb/>window closed, all as one did with all the other
<lb/>colors; being dry; if it is for making flowers, one 
<lb/>needs to polish it with the hands only; then fold
<lb/>them, and put them in a paper; one needs to do
<lb/>like that also, with all the colors that you make,
<lb/>for making flowers; B when it is not for making
<lb/>flowers with, one needs always to iron it all with
<lb/>an iron as one irons linens; ~
<lb/>Red cloth, and violet, is made as
<lb/>red silk, and violet, but instead of
<lb/>vinegar, one can take rain water
