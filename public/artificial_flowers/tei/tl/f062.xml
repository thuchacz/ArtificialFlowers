<lb/>one needs to take care to note let it boil,
<lb/>next, one leaves it to draw [itself out], like that on
<lb/>the chafing dish + + or foot stove until such time that the soup becomes
<lb/>thick, and that it sticks to the finger, and that it is
<lb/>congealed, that done, one puts it to heat, to
<lb/>de-congeal it, then, one takes the leather out of the
<lb/>soup, fo press it with the hands, until such
<lb/>time that the soup is a little outside of [the leather], next
<lb/>one passes the said soup through a linen cloth, and
<lb/>one stiffens the cambric with [it], one needs to
<lb/>maintain always the temperature, in order that the
<lb/>cambric, and the glue do not congeal
<lb/>in the hands at all, one needs to plunge only two
<lb/>or three pieces at a time, and hang them immediately,
<lb/>to avoid this inconvenience, the cambric being
<lb/>dry, if one sees that it is too stiff to
<lb/>use, before plunging other pieces
<lb/>of cambric, one needs to pour into the glue
<lb/>three or four, spoons of water, more or less
<lb/>according to the quantity of glue that one sees,
<lb/>but the best is, not to put water in the glue, since the stuffs,
<lb/>or cambric becomes [too] pliable after . . . 
<lb/>Note, that one must never pour water,
<lb/>into fish glue, ~~~~
<lb/>I misspoke, here above, as you can see; ~~~
