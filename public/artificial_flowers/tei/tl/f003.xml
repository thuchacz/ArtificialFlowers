<lb/>Way to undye cambric dyed with gamboge
<lb/>One needs to tie up the
<lb/>piece of cambric [to a rod?] quasi all as large as
<lb/>the piece and, next to wet it a bit,
<lb/>and rub it between the hands, well enough, then
<lb/>one needs to plunge it and wash it in hot water,
<lb/>or else in lye, like one
<lb/>washes white cambric, changing the water
<lb/>from time to time, until such that the
<lb/>cambric becomes perfectly white. One needs to tie up
<lb/>the piece of cambric two or three times for
<lb/>this end.
<lb/>Cambric, dyed with saffron and
<lb/>gamboge, is undyed in the same manner also
<lb/>The way to undye crimson or incarlacque fabric
<lb/>One needs to take two pints of lye, made from vine
<lb/>ashes, with a half pint of rainwater or fountain water.
<lb/>One must boil that together with some small pieces of
<lb/>crimson fabric, which you all let boil until such that the
<lb/>dye becomes boiled out of the fabric and it becomes all undyed. Next one
<lb/>needs to take it out of the earthenware pot, which you keep for this use, and
<lb/>after having pressed the lye out, one + needs to take yet an other piece
<lb/>of incarlacque and make it boil in the same manner. But
<lb/>each time that you press the lye out, one needs always to re-cast
<lb/>it into the pot. One needs to continue like that all until such that you
<lb/>see that the incarlacque does not undye further and that it remains beautiful. A dont
<lb/>is the dye good, a dont one needs to take the gum that you have 
<lb/>soaked and melted for a space of 24 hours. In stirring from time
<lb/>to time, being still rather thick, one needs to pass it through a very white
<lb/>cloth. Next one needs to throw the gum in the said dye and let it
<lb/>boil all together until such time that the soup becomes very thick, a
<lb/>dont you can use it to draw with a paintbrush. ✠
