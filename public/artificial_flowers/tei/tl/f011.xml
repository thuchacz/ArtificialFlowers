<lb/>The brown-blue and pale blue for
<lb/>archbishops, once cut, one needs to trace
<lb/>them with carmine.
<lb/>Another blue that one uses for
<lb/>the underside of archbishops, which one sees
<lb/>hardly at all because the colors are not worth anything
<lb/>even though they are beautiful in appearance. 
<lb/>One needs to take a square or two of lacmus
<lb/>that one pounds, well bound in a good
<lb/>cloth, then put it to soak for one day and one
<lb/>night. Next, you boil it with a
<lb/>pint and a half of rainwater, better too little than
<lb/>too much. Pressing the cloth with a stick
<lb/>where it is blue, and inside, so that all of the blue
<lb/>leaves it. Then one needs to put the cambric or
<lb/>the cloths in the soup to boil together.
<lb/>Being boiled a little, one needs to take it
<lb/>out of the soup and hang it over cords.
<lb/>Being dry, if they are plainly not blue
<lb/>enough, one can plunge them again
<lb/>in the same soup, and that several times
<lb/>if there is need. Being dry, one
<lb/>puts them in fish glue or hide glue.
