<lb/>it with the cold soup that
<lb/>came from the scum, and once the
<lb/>dye boils, then put it in the pot
<lb/>where the bloom is, boiling it all
<lb/>so that the bloom does not clump.
<lb/>Once the dye becomes purple, then
<lb/>put some more tartar with the bloom
<lb/>until you see that it is a beautiful
<lb/>color. Note that the dye
<lb/>cannot be bottled and cannot
<lb/>be kept for long, but
<lb/>can be reboiled if it has
<lb/>become purple. Let it boil
<lb/>a bit. Then put some tartar in
<lb/>another pot, pour the dye over
<lb/>it, take the foam off, and if
<lb/>it is still too purple, put some
<lb/>more tartar with it until that you see
<lb/>that it is beautiful. And once no more
<lb/>foam appears, one must
<lb/>let it stand until it settles.
<lb/>Then pour it gently out.
<lb/>See if the sediment is good,
<lb/>as [you did] before, and put it in a pot.
<lb/>Let it come to a boil.
<lb/>Take some bloom, as was said
<lb/>before. The dryer the place 
<lb/>where the dye is kept, the
<lb/>better it will keep.
<lb/>One can also paint with this.
<lb/>And if one wants to have
<lb/>light yellow, one must put some
<lb/>rainwater with it.
