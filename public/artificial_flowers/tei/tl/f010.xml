<lb/>and fish glue. One
<lb/>needs to cut the cambric in the length of
<lb/>two or three quarters and the width of three tailes [full sizes?]
<lb/>or a half square. Each piece of cambric
<lb/>or muslin must be washed piece by
<lb/>piece in the glue without taking more glue
<lb/>than that needed for the piece to be completely wet with the
<lb/>blue too. Then rub the blue very gently into
<lb/>the cambric, and when it is very blue, one needs to hold
<lb/>each one by the end in the hand and next pass
<lb/>the hand over it, from one end to the other, then back
<lb/>again, and so forth to make it 
<lb/>very even. Next, you attach it or hang it 
<lb/>by cord. But if the cambric is dry and
<lb/>it is not blue enough, one needs to plunge it again
<lb/>once more in the same soup, and do as
<lb/>above but without using starch white. These
<lb/>cambrics and[=are?] for making alimon, which one
<lb/>calls archbishops, as also for hyacinths and
<lb/>bleuels, &amp;c. ~~~ hide glue is
<lb/>		also good for making that
<lb/>		and is even better than the other
<lb/>Pale blue is made in the same way
<lb/>but instead of taking starch brown-blue
<lb/>one needs to take starch pale-blue. ~
<lb/>This muslin is used for the beginning
<lb/>of archbishops; note that pale blue is made with
<lb/>		starch brown-blue
<lb/>		[and] is the most beautiful of all the other
<lb/>		colors
<lb/>Note: archbishops are blue or violet alimon;
