<lb/>one pours it again into another, if
<lb/>there is need, but when the sun
<lb/>does not shine, one puts the shell on a
<lb/>chafing dish very tepid, and next one does as
<lb/>here before, then one plunges the paintbrush into
<lb/>the dye, and one traces on the paper
<lb/>with [it], for seeing if the color is good,
<lb/>but, if one sees, that the color is not
<lb/>good yet, and a little thick, one needs to
<lb/>wait one day longer to use it,
<lb/>next one does one's best to
<lb/>use this dye in a day, or two,
<lb/>because it becomes too thick to 
<lb/>use, so much that one is obligated, to
<lb/>pour into it two, or three drops of water, and that
<lb/>is why the dye traced upon
<lb/>the paper, passes very easily, and
<lb/>also does not last too long, ~~
<lb/>In the same way also, one
<lb/>readies the color violet, but instead
<lb/>of brazil wood, one needs to take,
<lb/>logwood. ~~~
<lb/>The way for melting silk gum, as
<lb/>here before; return four folios; ~~~
