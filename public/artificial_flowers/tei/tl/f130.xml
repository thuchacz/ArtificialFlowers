<lb/>JESUS, MARY, AUGUSTINE.
<lb/>Since the Holy Spirit allows us to praise, after death, those people who deserve
<lb/>to be praised; it is beyond just, to give a tribute so legitimate to the memory of the
<lb/>REVEREND MOTHER
<lb/>MOTHER ADRIENE TERESE DE MALDEGHEM,
<lb/>Cannonesse Regular of the Order of St. Augustine, who died in Tournai in the Monastery of Our Lady of Sion
<lb/>on the 28th of the year 1680, among the prayers and sorrows of her dear Sisters, after having received the Holy Sacraments of the Church
<lb/>with as much piety, as resignation to the Divine will. 65 years of age, &amp; Professed of her vows for 48, a life that had been as
<lb/>Religious as hers for so many years, could not have promised an ending less Happy: grace
<lb/>perfecting the advantages pulled from her Illustrious Lineage, rendered her a living example of all the virtues,
<lb/>&amp; a subject wholly suited for the governance of others; which was brightly visible throughout her Life, &amp; and in the
<lb/>functions that she exercised as Mistress of the Novices; as Sub-prioress &amp; Prioress with this wise, prudent, steadfast,
<lb/>&amp; Holy Conduct that was inseparable from her character: BUT, following what St Paul said; even though his conscience reproached
<lb/>him with nothing, he was not yet Justified, what Holiness could deliver a person from this healthy fear of the
<lb/>Judgments of God! Thus although we have so many Indications of her eternal happiness, we implore Sacrifices
<lb/>&amp; prayers; Such that if divine Justice should demand of her any remaining expiation in Purgatory, she might as soon as possible
<lb/>be in a state to enjoy the chaste embraces of her heavenly Spouse, These are the charitable services that
<lb/>we demand of the Religious Communities, &amp; of all the faithful.
<lb/>May she rest in peace.
</ab>
