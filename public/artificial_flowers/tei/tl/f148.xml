<lb/>To dye a red color on white 
<lb/>horn, up to a quarter
<lb/>of horn:
<lb/>We take, for 9 large
<lb/>cochenille insects with a half ounce of red red alum
<lb/>put 3 pints of fountain water.
<lb/>One must seethe these together until
<lb/>the soup becomes red. Once done,
<lb/>one must put the quarter of horn
<lb/>in there, in good order, and one
<lb/>lets it seethe until it is a beautiful
<lb/>pink color. Once done, one must
<lb/>take them out of the soup and let [them]
<lb/>dry without rinsing [them], and on
<lb/>top of one another until [they] are somewhat dry
<lb/>—----------------------------------------------------------
<lb/>and once done, open [them].
<lb/>The way to dye white
<lb/>horn, to make it a pink color,
<lb/>that you see the pattern here, this is sold
<lb/>one buys this from the merchant
<lb/>and from the hair dresser, the and [from] other
<lb/>people who make flowers
<lb/>in the world.
