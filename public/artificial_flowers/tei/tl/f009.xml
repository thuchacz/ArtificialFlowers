<lb/>and plunge it into a small part of this water
<lb/>so well that you shouldn’t press the water out. After
<lb/>that, one needs to hang it from a cord. Being dry,
<lb/>one needs to do the same thing again until
<lb/>the moment that you see that the color is
<lb/>as you want to have it. Being dry,
<lb/>one needs to starch it in hide glue
<lb/>without pressing it out. This is why one needs
<lb/>to take only a small amount of the said glue
<lb/>so that the cambric becomes very well wetted
<lb/>without dripping once being hung by a cord.
