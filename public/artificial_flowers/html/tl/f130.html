<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>JESUS, MARY, AUGUSTINE.
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>Since the Holy Spirit allows us to praise, after death, those people who deserve
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>to be praised; it is beyond just, to give a tribute so legitimate to the memory of the
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>REVEREND MOTHER
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>MOTHER ADRIENE TERESE DE MALDEGHEM,
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>Cannonesse Regular of the Order of St. Augustine, who died in Tournai in the Monastery of Our Lady of Sion
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>on the 28th of the year 1680, among the prayers and sorrows of her dear Sisters, after having received the Holy Sacraments of the Church
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>with as much piety, as resignation to the Divine will. 65 years of age, &amp; Professed of her vows for 48, a life that had been as
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>Religious as hers for so many years, could not have promised an ending less Happy: grace
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>perfecting the advantages pulled from her Illustrious Lineage, rendered her a living example of all the virtues,
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>&amp; a subject wholly suited for the governance of others; which was brightly visible throughout her Life, &amp; and in the
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>functions that she exercised as Mistress of the Novices; as Sub-prioress &amp; Prioress with this wise, prudent, steadfast,
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>&amp; Holy Conduct that was inseparable from her character: BUT, following what St Paul said; even though his conscience reproached
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>him with nothing, he was not yet Justified, what Holiness could deliver a person from this healthy fear of the
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>Judgments of God! Thus although we have so many Indications of her eternal happiness, we implore Sacrifices
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>&amp; prayers; Such that if divine Justice should demand of her any remaining expiation in Purgatory, she might as soon as possible
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>be in a state to enjoy the chaste embraces of her heavenly Spouse, These are the charitable services that
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>we demand of the Religious Communities, &amp; of all the faithful.
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>May she rest in peace.
