sieve, this being done, before putting it into the
soup; the verdigris, being well mixed ~
and stirred in the said soup one puts it three
or four hours in the sun, next ~
one takes a little piece of sponge, and one ~
greens the paper in the same way, as
the preceding green. one needs to move the bottom, from time,
note: if there is no sun, one skips this step; to time. ~
Red paper is made in the same way
also, one takes clear gum, with a
little + half packet of vermillion, that one mixes well
together, the vermillion being well mixed, one
pours once more a little half spoon, of the
said gum, with two or three spoonfuls of water,
one needs to stir the whole together well, next
one leaves it like that, two, or three hours
more, or less, before using it, ✠ then
one reddens the paper with it, one needs to move the
bottom, before reddening, and the second time that
one reddens the paper, one needs to pass the sponge
very lightly, and do one's [best] possible in order that
the paper will be beautiful red enough, being reddened
twice on each side,. one passes over it also,
twice on each side, egg white, very 
lightly ; But for green paper ; and yellow, etc.
It suffices to pass over, with the egg ~
white, on each side, once. ~~~
