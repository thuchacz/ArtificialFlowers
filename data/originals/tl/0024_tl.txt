that with a light hand, as quickly as one
can, until such time as the cambric is very
red, and well penetrated in the dye, then
one washes it piece, by piece, a little, and one ~
presses it with the hand, as hard as one can, ~
then one throws it in the verjus piece, by piece, one needs to 
work it well, and plunge, then one needs to press the verjus outside. ~~
Next one throws them in a terrine, prepared 
with three pints of water, to rinse them, one piece
at a time, one needs to work it well, but without
rubbing, in any way, from there one takes it from
this water, one needs to + a little press + the water outside, and one throws it
in four, or three, other terrines in succession,
prepared with two pints of water, in each
terrine, ✠ when one is at the final water, one
needs to press the water very hard out of the cambric, ~
 next one puts it, and plunges in a half
pint of verjus, more, or less, hauling it up
so that one can see, the quantity of cambric, in
pulling the cambric, piece, by piece, out of the verjus
~ one presses it in the hand, not quite as strongly
~ as before, next on puts it in a
very clean terrine, and very dry, waiting
for all the other pale colors to be
dyed, to hang them, all together in
the attic, with the windows closed, likewise all the other
yellowish colors, etc.,
This done, one washes again one piece ~
of cambric, in the soup wetting it ~
in the vinegar also, if there is any left, 
✠but without pressing the water outside, except at the 
last rinse;~
