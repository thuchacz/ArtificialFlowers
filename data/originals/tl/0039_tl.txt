For making paper yellow, one takes the
size of two, or three big nuts, of
gamboge that one puts to soak in a little
pot with fountain, or rain, water ~
and that [is] the quantity for covering in yellow
well, and a bit on top [of that]; one puts there also
to soak for five, or six liards, of saffron,
whole, without being pestled, being well soaked
one could boil it if one wanted, next
one pours a little of this soup, in the
gamboge, which one mixes well together; from there
one yellows the paper, but if one sees that the ~
paper is not beautiful, or high yellow enough, one ~
there pours again some saffron soup, until such
time as, that the whole is to your liking, but
when the soup is too thick, one needs to put there
a little more water, the paper yellowed two
times, on each side, when the colors are good;
makes a very beautiful paper,
and even once also; ~
note that the egg white must
be well beaten before
you use it; ~
Way for accommodating dye, for 
painting flowers on paper, gamboge ~
mixes itself, and one puts it to soak in the same
way, as I said here before, but instead of
taking so large a quantity of gamboge, one
only puts to soak the size of one + big nut; and
water. In hauling it out; next one traces with the
paintbrush, without the use of saffron. ~
