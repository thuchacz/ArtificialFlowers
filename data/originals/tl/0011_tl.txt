and fish glue. One
needs to cut the cambric in the length of
two or three quarters and the width of three tailes [full sizes?]
or a half square. Each piece of cambric
or muslin must be washed piece by
piece in the glue without taking more glue
than that needed for the piece to be completely wet with the
blue too. Then rub the blue very gently into
the cambric, and when it is very blue, one needs to hold
each one by the end in the hand and next pass
the hand over it, from one end to the other, then back
again, and so forth to make it 
very even. Next, you attach it or hang it 
by cord. But if the cambric is dry and
it is not blue enough, one needs to plunge it again
once more in the same soup, and do as
above but without using starch white. These
cambrics and[=are?] for making alimon, which one
calls archbishops, as also for hyacinths and
bleuels, &c. ~~~ hide glue is
		also good for making that
		and is even better than the other
Pale blue is made in the same way
but instead of taking starch brown-blue
one needs to take starch pale-blue. ~
This muslin is used for the beginning
of archbishops; note that pale blue is made with
		starch brown-blue
		[and] is the most beautiful of all the other
		colors
Note: archbishops are blue or violet alimon;
