it with the cold soup that
came from the scum, and once the
dye boils, then put it in the pot
where the bloom is, boiling it all
so that the bloom does not clump.
Once the dye becomes purple, then
put some more tartar with the bloom
until you see that it is a beautiful
color. Note that the dye
cannot be bottled and cannot
be kept for long, but
can be reboiled if it has
become purple. Let it boil
a bit. Then put some tartar in
another pot, pour the dye over
it, take the foam off, and if
it is still too purple, put some
more tartar with it until that you see
that it is beautiful. And once no more
foam appears, one must
let it stand until it settles.
Then pour it gently out.
See if the sediment is good,
as [you did] before, and put it in a pot.
Let it come to a boil.
Take some bloom, as was said
before. The dryer the place 
where the dye is kept, the
better it will keep.
One can also paint with this.
And if one wants to have
light yellow, one must put some
rainwater with it.
