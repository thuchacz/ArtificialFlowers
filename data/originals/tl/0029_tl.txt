and printing parchment, is the month of
May, or just as well the start of the month of
June, and like [this] too, the start of the month of + August and
of September, also for making velum green,
or otherwise said, parchment. ~~
Way to wash the velum. One needs to
put to soak in the evening, and the next day, one
washes it, as one washes the laundry, piece by piece,
in rain water or fountain water, entirely
cold, without ever heating it. Nor
for the soaking, because the velum or parchment,
will become as easy to tear
as paper in heating the water. One washes it
in this way, twice a day, changing
the water each time, and this thusly eight days in
a row. But when the parchment is written [upon] with
red letters, one needs to scrape the said letter. After ~
having washed the parchment, two or three days, one
takes it out of the water, and one spreads it out on a
very smooth board, all wet like it is, one scrapes the
red letters with the sharp edge of a pen-knife or a knife,
grating [it]. One needs to hold one's hand very lightly, and
turn the parchment on both sides. If there are ~
red letters there too, one needs to scrape so well that one
cannot see anything of the red, because the green doesn't have enough strength
to cover the red, nor musical notes,
as it is not appropriate for making green. . ~~~
