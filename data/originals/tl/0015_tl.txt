The blue for flowers, which one calls
areniez, is made with English ash, 
in the same manner as the starch blue, 
but the blue of English ash does not 
have to be rubbed into the toile as strongly as the 
starch blue, because the color is finer
and it suffices, that the cambric has the color of 
this blue, ~~~
For making red ones one needs to take
some vermillion, and hide glue,;
the toiles being cut, in leaves, one needs to put a 
clear carmine on top,: fish glue is
also good, but with hide glue, the carmine
is easier to trace, one needs to rub the cambric
in the said soup, as you did
with the English ash, this toile is useful 
for making ranunculus, allimone, and Constantinople tulip ~~~
The green toiles are made with hide glue,
and some green from the bottle, without white
starch; fish glue is also good,
but dried cambric, one needs to plunge it 
again into this glue because
the green thins it too much, but hide glue
