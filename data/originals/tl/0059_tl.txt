nothing, to be used for another thing, next
one needs to keep stoking it, from time,
to time, until such time, that the whole, is consumed
into ash. ~~~
Way for making lye of ~
vine ash, one needs to take three
double handfuls of ash, with
seven or eight pints of rain, or fountain,
water, one needs to leave it to boil, until
[it reduces to] four, or five pints, all the more,
if one boils them in a marmite + + well covered, one must,
as soon as the marmite is removed from the fire,
pour it into an earthenware pot, very
tidy, and having been used for anything else,
other than for dyeing pink, one needs
to leave the ashes at the bottom of the marmite,
as much as one can, next the next day,
one needs to pass the lye through a
linen cloth, into another pot, pouring
it all gently, without moving the ash,
which are at the bottom of the pot, from there, one
can use it, for all that one 
wants to make, with the said lye. ~~
