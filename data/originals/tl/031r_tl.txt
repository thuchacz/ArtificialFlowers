To dye a red color on white 
horn, up to a quarter
of horn:
We take, for 9 large
cochenille insects with a half ounce of red red alum
put 3 pints of fountain water.
One must seethe these together until
the soup becomes red. Once done,
one must put the quarter of horn
in there, in good order, and one
lets it seethe until it is a beautiful
pink color. Once done, one must
take them out of the soup and let [them]
dry without rinsing [them], and on
top of one another until [they] are somewhat dry
—----------------------------------------------------------
and once done, open [them].
The way to dye white
horn, to make it a pink color,
that you see the pattern here, this is sold
one buys this from the merchant
and from the hair dresser, the and [from] other
people who make flowers
in the world.
