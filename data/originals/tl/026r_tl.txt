Mr Joris, druggist, sells brazilwood
wood that is very good for painting
paper red. One does this as follows:
for two stuivers’s or five’s worth of
this wood according to the puddle that one wants
to make. And for the nicest, take but
a half of it. And put it in a pot with
a can or three pints of rainwater.
Let it extract somewhat and then cook[boil?] it for half an hour
or somewhat more. Then a piece of red alum,
finely pounded, but one must first, in a dish or pan,
smilten[melt?] [it] on its own. But one must understand that this does not
appear red but is white, but it is so named. And with
the outside also cooked, while the wood has simmered
for so long, then you pour the soup of alum in the
first pot and stir it around with a stocktien. Then the
whole thing becomes red. And let it simmer together somewhat, then pour some
soup in a little pot. And once it is cool, take white paper and lay it on
