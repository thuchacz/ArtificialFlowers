Note if you see that the dye is too thick
with a glass of hide glue; one needs to take
more still, all until such time that the soup is good ◆
Note when you would like to make less a dont [which?] one needs to 
take some vermillion, and some mien [mine?] to your liking,
and mix them well in hide glue; next take all at 
once that which you have prepared for dyeing; and throw it right away 
into the glue, or otherwise said in the soup; one needs to rub it very little,
but instead of this, one needs to press it very well, and 
put it back, and open it up; and after that press it again, and put it back,
all until such time that the dye is well penetrated in 
the cambric; in the end, if you see that you have too much
soup, or that the cambric is too wetted, one needs to put
still more pieces of cambric inside, so well that you 
should not have to press anything out; one still needs to press it all 
together; so that it penetrates in the dye also;
But if you see to the contrary, that you do not have 
enough glue and dye for the quantity that you have
started to dye; a dons [then?], one needs to take all of the fabric out,
next pour the glue, in the saucer; and one needs to mix 
in still more dye, after that throw it the mass inside;
and do as here before; but the glue, and the cambric, must be hot
