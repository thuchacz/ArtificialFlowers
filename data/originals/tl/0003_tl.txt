Way for melting silk gum, or other-
wise said tragacanth gum;
One takes for this one patar of the said gum; it
is necessary to put it to soak, in a half pint
of rainwater, better more than less. One needs to
leave it like that for two days, then one needs to take
a spoon and stir it well, and hit it with it
until such time it becomes a clear glue-pap, and if
one sees that the soup is too thick, one needs
to pour in a bit of water, until such time that it
is good; then one needs to make it boil, a
bit, and that while stirring it still. After that,
one needs to pass it through a cloth, and after that,
use it to starch silk with it.
Way to make silk flowers
Note: when the silk is very well peniez, put it on top
of glass, very flat, the size of one window pane,
reasonably big enough. Next, one needs to take the flat side of a knife,
and take the silk gum with it. Next, one needs to spread it on top
of the silk with it, and that also for a long time, that the silk becomes very well
moistened, and fatty. After that, one needs to turn it over, and
one needs to do the same. After that, one needs to put it on top of a
towel, to let it dry in the wind, and or otherwise also.
Next one needs to apply it, and put it on top of the form; and 
go over it with a pierre liquoire. And dry it near to
the fire, and or else above a stove. Next, remove it
from there. And then cut flowers from it, of all kinds
that you want to make. But one needs always to keep
silk prepared for making flowers between white paper.
The same also for silk that is not yet prepared for making flowers.
