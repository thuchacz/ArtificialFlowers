To make green paper
Take the greens of celery, the youngest of all the ribs,
removed and pounded in a mortar, then
wrung out, and then pounded again, three times.
Then take verdigris and boil it in the soup
until it is melted. Put in as much as
you want to have green. The more green, the
higher [=more intense] the color. Also, a bit of tartar. From time
to time, stir until the whole thing is melted. Then take
the paper and lay it on a table or board. Then take
a little painter’s knife and stroke it thereover.
Then the one side being done, leave it to dry,
and being well dry, then do the other side, and
that so many times until it is green enough.
After that, according to taste, take then egg white,
stroke it thereover to give a glare once
it is very dry.
