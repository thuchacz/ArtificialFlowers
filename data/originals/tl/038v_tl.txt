Come, for you must clean it off.
You should take the paper
but do not hang it
to dry, rather lay it
on leather or sticks, and it
must be fully dry. Before you
even go over [wipe] it, the weather must
be fair to do this.
you must go over the right side 6 times
and then the other side 3 to 4 times.

I should guess put
in a quarter of verdigris
for the first time, and
it must be pounded. and then
further add a can of rain
water and a bit more than
an ounce of tartar, and a
half a spoon of pounded alum
