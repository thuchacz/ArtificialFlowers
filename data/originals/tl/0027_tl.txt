for otherwise it is not necessary to put it
in the vinegar, because the soup, is sour from the
first cambric, then one washes again another 
piece, if one sees that the soup is giving color
still, then one does, as here before, this cambric
must be kept from the elements, because the color
is not so pure as the first, and it sticks
to itself, ~~~  Note; when one wants
to have very red cambrics, one needs to rinse them, only
in three terrines of water ◆
Note, one pound of safflower, for one 
pound of cambric makes a beautiful color; but
one ounce, or an ounce and a half less, makes a
more beautiful color; and when one wants to have
several red brown colors; one needs to divide
the soup, in three parts; and take
some cambric as you wish, one time
a little more, and the other time a little 
less; and hauling it up such that you see that the
color is as one wants to have it, ~~~
 that which follows is to make, several pale colors
for pinks &c. ~~ 
After the first cambric is rinsed,
one takes, two, or three pieces of cambric, or of ~
muslin, all dry, and very white,
without putting it in the vinegar; and one washes it
all immediately in :+: :+:: the verjus, then one presses it outside, and one throws it in:+: the first rinse, one 
washes it also + + a long time, that it becomes red, next one
