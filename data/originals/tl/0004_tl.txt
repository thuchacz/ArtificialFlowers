Way to undye cambric dyed with gamboge
One needs to tie up the
piece of cambric [to a rod?] quasi all as large as
the piece and, next to wet it a bit,
and rub it between the hands, well enough, then
one needs to plunge it and wash it in hot water,
or else in lye, like one
washes white cambric, changing the water
from time to time, until such that the
cambric becomes perfectly white. One needs to tie up
the piece of cambric two or three times for
this end.
Cambric, dyed with saffron and
gamboge, is undyed in the same manner also
The way to undye crimson or incarlacque fabric
One needs to take two pints of lye, made from vine
ashes, with a half pint of rainwater or fountain water.
One must boil that together with some small pieces of
crimson fabric, which you all let boil until such that the
dye becomes boiled out of the fabric and it becomes all undyed. Next one
needs to take it out of the earthenware pot, which you keep for this use, and
after having pressed the lye out, one + needs to take yet an other piece
of incarlacque and make it boil in the same manner. But
each time that you press the lye out, one needs always to re-cast
it into the pot. One needs to continue like that all until such that you
see that the incarlacque does not undye further and that it remains beautiful. A dont
is the dye good, a dont one needs to take the gum that you have 
soaked and melted for a space of 24 hours. In stirring from time
to time, being still rather thick, one needs to pass it through a very white
cloth. Next one needs to throw the gum in the said dye and let it
boil all together until such time that the soup becomes very thick, a
dont you can use it to draw with a paintbrush. ✠
