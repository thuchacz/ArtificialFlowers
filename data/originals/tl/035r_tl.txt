To dye paper yellow
One takes a sisein [=coinage type] of saffron, which one lets extract in the quantity
of a pint of water. Once it is reasonably well extracted, one pours it off
and puts some more water over the saffron to further extract it. One
must also have an ounce of gum, which must be soaked for a few days 
ahead of time and poured into the extracted saffron once it is cold.
[THU: note the “once it is cold” at the end, which is the only clue that the extraction of the saffron takes place with heat]
