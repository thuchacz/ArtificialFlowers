of our verdigris,
a half pound of white wax,
and three quarters of other
a half pound, and a half
quarter a rinschen hast [that you have rinsed?];
all of it well melted and stir [it] together without
boi boiling. Next [one] needs to plunge the
paper inside [with] a bande [i.e. length of fabric] at the same time
the width of three taille [regular size?], roughly,
but the same length as the the paper is
in its length.
This is for the confectioner
who make desserts, and because
you want to make [it] with [it].
But if you see that the paper
is not as green as you wish,
into this you need to put more
of the green of Spain, or otherwise said,
verdegris.
