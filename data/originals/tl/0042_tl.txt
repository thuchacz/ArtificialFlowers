Note, again another way, for the same red;
✠ Take for one patard of brazil wood, and for
two liards alum, with two pints of old beer, the older,
is the best; leave that to boil together, until [reduced by]
half; next one passes the soup through a clear
linen cloth, and one pours it into a bottle; and when
one wants to use it, and paint with it; one pours
of this red dye, into a mussel shell, or
just as well into an oyster shell, and leave it like that
5. or 6. hours. and if you can put it several
hours in the sun, the dye will be ready sooner to 
use, provided that the sun is not too ardent;
for the dye would be in little time, too diminished, and
dry in the shell; after that, one needs to pour off the clear [liquid] into
another shell very clean also, and some hours later,
again pour it into another shell; one needs to continue
like this, two or three times, if there is need; for when the
dye becomes a little thick, this marks [the point that] it is good for tracing
on cambric, and on paper; you can test with the
paintbrush if the color is good, for your use; Note,
In the same way also one readies, or prepares the color
violet; but instead of brazil wood; one needs to take some
logwood; Note that one needs for it to be good beer, without
being mixed, when it will be ten. and 20. years old) One makes
red paper of this also, with the two reds, and some violet also ~~
