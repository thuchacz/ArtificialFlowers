four hours, more or less. Next, one needs
to throw  the clear water away and keep the bottom.
Then one needs to take your cloth and cambric
and plunge it into a small part of this water
so well that you shouldn’t press the water out. After

one needs to do the same thing again until
the moment that you see that the color is
as you want to have it. Being dry,
one needs to starch it in hide glue
without pressing it out. This is why one needs
to take only a small amount of the said glue
so that the cambric becomes very well wetted
without dripping once being hung by a cord.
