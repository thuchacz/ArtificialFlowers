The brown-blue and pale blue for
archbishops, once cut, one needs to trace
them with carmine.
Another blue that one uses for
the underside of archbishops, which one sees
hardly at all because the colors are not worth anything
even though they are beautiful in appearance. 
One needs to take a square or two of lacmus
that one pounds, well bound in a good
cloth, then put it to soak for one day and one
night. Next, you boil it with a
pint and a half of rainwater, better too little than
too much. Pressing the cloth with a stick
where it is blue, and inside, so that all of the blue
leaves it. Then one needs to put the cambric or
the cloths in the soup to boil together.
Being boiled a little, one needs to take it
out of the soup and hang it over cords.
Being dry, if they are plainly not blue
enough, one can plunge them again
in the same soup, and that several times
if there is need. Being dry, one
puts them in fish glue or hide glue.
