one pours it again into another, if
there is need, but when the sun
does not shine, one puts the shell on a
chafing dish very tepid, and next one does as
here before, then one plunges the paintbrush into
the dye, and one traces on the paper
with [it], for seeing if the color is good,
but, if one sees, that the color is not
good yet, and a little thick, one needs to
wait one day longer to use it,
next one does one's best to
use this dye in a day, or two,
because it becomes too thick to 
use, so much that one is obligated, to
pour into it two, or three drops of water, and that
is why the dye traced upon
the paper, passes very easily, and
also does not last too long, ~~
In the same way also, one
