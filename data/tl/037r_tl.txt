To make green dye
For a half pound of verdigris,
take two cans of rain
water and add a half a
quarter of tartar, and
a pan spoon [pennelepel = large copper spoon used in baking] of pounded alum.
Preserve it for one night
in a copper bucket or pan. It must
be foamy, [geschumt = geschuimt] and
must boil down by half.
take the green juice
in it as long as it is blood-warm.
[and is]
Verdigris is blue by itself.
Take the green juice on the 
point of a knife, and should you
fear that the verdigris on the side
of your pan is not green enough,
do not do too much to it,
but try it on paper until the
color is to your liking,
and in case you see that
the coloring of your paper is a bit
too blue, you must
put some more put green color in a dish
and add some. [illeg.]
