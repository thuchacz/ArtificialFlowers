After, one pulls the safflower out of the bag and puts it
in a large, flat[-bottomed] pot, and once everything is thoroughly picked
[out of the bag], one sprinkles there a little rain or fountain water
over [it]. Then one pours into the safflower a pint of lye made
from the ashes of grapevine tendrils. Then is the pot covered
with another of the same size, so that it
can catch the air. Set it in a dark place,
set a covering-cloth over it, and let it proceed
for 2 hours, and [it] must then be bruised for 15 minutes.
One must remove it by handfuls. Once one can
take no more [out], pour the rest into the bag again, [and] this
is wrung out into a clean pot. One prepares immediately
another pot with some white wine vinegar, in which the fabric
is made wet. Being well drunk, one takes these [i.e., the vinegar-soaked fabric and the lyed petals]
all together, gives them into the hands of the person that
bruised and and wrung out the safflower, which entire mass alike had
been set in the dye. Wash these same [things] well one by one.
Proceed with a light hand as quickly as is possible.
The fabric, having her color, is washed again, piece by
piece, after having removed [un-dunked] it well. Put them in verjuice
after [they] are squeezed out as before. [They] are rinsed in three or 4
pots following before prepared with 2 or 3 pints of clean
rain or fountain water, where after one washes a few pieces of fabric
therein [once] the first color is rinsed in, which serves
as a pale color and is then dried together in the attic. [is there a little flower at the end?]
