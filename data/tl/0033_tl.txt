Way to green the stems of flowers,
one puts in a dish, a good spoon
of little white, like the painter +uses, for the firstcolor + that one mixes with
clear/white gum, for this end, one ~
puts it to soak five or six days in advance, a
large handful of gum, as much as one can hold in one hand, better more, than less;
before mixing the little white one passes
the gum, through a very white cloth, like
I said for the green, next one mixes with,
two, or three spoons, of very white gamboge,
then one pours the green on top, and the
rest of the gum also, but when the thick
green, is not sufficient, to green well, one
pours some green from the bottle; until such time
that the whole is just as you wish, next
one leaves it to become thick like pap,
stirring it two, or three times, each day,
this having been done; one applies it on the stems
of flowers, with a paintbrush, the stems being
dry, if they are not even, one paints them
with the paintbrush, once more, and that
several times, if there is need. but once is best;
and if the stems do not shine
enough at all to your
wishes one needs to pass over with the paintbrush of egg white, well beaten; ~~~
One does the same way, for the stems of
carnations, and that without using gamboge,
