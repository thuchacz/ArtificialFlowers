throw it in the soapy wash of white soap; next one
washes it as clear, as one sees to be enough, then one 
needs to rinse it, in two rain waters, at the last
one needs to press the water out well; from there, dry it; and
being dry; one needs to plunge it well, and stiffen it in
hide glue; after that one needs to hang it in the attic
on a horsehair cord, and that as evenly as you can
one needs to take good care that the end, and the rest does not stick
together, for when it is dry, you would have to
tear it to detach one from the other; one does not need to
press the hide glue strongly out of your cambric etc. but 
leave it a little well wet; one needs to do the same with all
the colors you make with [it]; the same also with fish
glue; Note, when you would like to have a more
heightened color still, than the jonquil color, instead of leaving it to soak
for half an hour; one needs to leave it to soak three quarters of an hour, and one needs
to leave it to boil a longer time also; but if this is for making flowers;
gamboge, and saffron, is better still; as here above;
