Note, before pouring the safflower into 
the little sack, in order to wring it more easily,
one needs to take in one hand a
handful of safflower; and press it like that
in the soup; next, being very well pressed,
all of the soup [being] outside, one needs to continue like
that, all until the time, that all of the safflower is
pressed; next one needs to pour it immediately into

pint and a half, more or less, according to the quantity
of safflower; you can pour on the safflower
