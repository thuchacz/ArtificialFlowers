succession, to the last, one needs to 
press the water outside well, from there one puts it in
the verjus; next one takes again 
another piece, and one does as the first,
and one continues it [with] the other pieces of cambric ~
Like that, until the time that the rinse, 
gives no more colors, as appropriate and ~
when one removes the cambric out of the verjus, one
does not need to strongly press it in the hand;
Note the last [point on] verjus: shortly after, [it] spoils the
colors, this is why it is effaced [above]:
Note, that all of the earthenware pots, must be 
new, and very clean, next take
care about this ,.~~~
Note✠ ✠
The cambric being quite dry, one plunges it
into the fish glue. One needs not to
take more glue than that the first
colors should be well moistened; one does the same
with pale colors as well. The cambric being
quite dry, one polishes them with the hand, from
both sides, and one folds them, each color inside
a white paper. And when one wants to use
them, one takes only one or two pieces of them at
a time. ~~~~ Note: as I said before this,
that the cords must be of
horsehair in order to not attach, with the pins the cambrics
to the cord.
Note, the most favourable weather, for ~
dyeing pink, and like [this] too ~
all the other colors, even also for washing
