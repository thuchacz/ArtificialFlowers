larger work, so must one take larger
quantities of gall and brandy.
Note: if you only wish to make light work,
with 4 or 5 ground [layers] to lay
it is already enough. ~~~~
Note that eel gall is only 
for illuminating but not for
drawing with a paintbrush on
little images. To that end, brandy
works well on its own. Also one or two little
drops of rainwater or fountain water, this is the best
to put in the shell with gold or silver and therewith to
gild with foam[?] gold or silver. The
ground must be made slightly wet with 
well beaten egg white, but overall well wet.
Thereafter, one lays the gold or the silver foam thereupon,
fine or rough, one puts it down with a small
brockskens sponge, well washed beforehand, [and]
thereafter squeezed out in a cloth, and thereafter,
gilded with. And if the sponge becomes somewhat
too dry, one does as before. ~~
Note: if it is with oil, one takes ghebrant[drying?]
oil and one makes it wet with this oil, and
[lays] silver or gold foam thereupon. And one
does with the sponge as before. ~~
