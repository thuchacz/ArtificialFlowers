half a glass of fish glue, then
mix well and break the starch white into the glue. Next one
needs to put the starch brown-blue in it, and mix it well. Then plunge
the cambric immediately into the soup, until the soup becomes completely penetrated
into the cambric but very well wet. One needs to open it well, and press, and
turn it over, and rub it a bit, many times, so that the white becomes well
penetrated into the cambric. From there, attach it to a cord with pins.~~
but if the cord is made of horse hair, it is enough to
hang it, taking care that the end from which it hangs
does not attach itself together. This command must be
observed for all other colors.

the glue and the green one drop or two of
gamboge.
