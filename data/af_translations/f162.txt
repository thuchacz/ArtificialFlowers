into which one adds more sap green still.
note that the paper you use for this
must be fine and [gesloten = dense, perhaps?],
and must be coated with
warm white starch on one side,
and not thick, and the starch should be
[made] very even in color with a
soft brush. then hang it to dry,
and when it is fully dry, lay it down
[passen = to fit] so it becomes smooth.
then take your green paint, and
a part of a sponge
to color your paper with,
first on the starched side and then
[maer naer den eersten en 2 keer = after the first 2 more times].
This must be done with a light hand
and sparingly so it does not flow, [als = when ]
you have gone over your sheet of paper with a light hand,
[sijnde = if ] there are still
streaks you have missed,
they should no longer be there.
