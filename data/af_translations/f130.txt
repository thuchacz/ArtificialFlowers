JESUS, MARY, AUGUSTINE.
Since the Holy Spirit allows us to praise, after death, those people who deserve
to be praised; it is beyond just, to give a tribute so legitimate to the memory of the
REVEREND MOTHER
MOTHER ADRIENE TERESE DE MALDEGHEM,
Cannonesse Regular of the Order of St. Augustine, who died in Tournai in the Monastery of Our Lady of Sion
on the 28th of the year 1680, among the prayers and sorrows of her dear Sisters, after having received the Holy Sacraments of the Church
with as much piety, as resignation to the Divine will. 65 years of age, & Professed of her vows for 48, a life that had been as
Religious as hers for so many years, could not have promised an ending less Happy: grace
perfecting the advantages pulled from her Illustrious Lineage, rendered her a living example of all the virtues,
& a subject wholly suited for the governance of others; which was brightly visible throughout her Life, & and in the
functions that she exercised as Mistress of the Novices; as Sub-prioress & Prioress with this wise, prudent, steadfast,
& Holy Conduct that was inseparable from her character: BUT, following what St Paul said; even though his conscience reproached
him with nothing, he was not yet Justified, what Holiness could deliver a person from this healthy fear of the
Judgments of God! Thus although we have so many Indications of her eternal happiness, we implore Sacrifices
& prayers; Such that if divine Justice should demand of her any remaining expiation in Purgatory, she might as soon as possible
be in a state to enjoy the chaste embraces of her heavenly Spouse, These are the charitable services that
we demand of the Religious Communities, & of all the faithful.
May she rest in peace.
