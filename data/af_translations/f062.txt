one needs to take care to note let it boil,
next, one leaves it to draw [itself out], like that on
the chafing dish + + or foot stove until such time that the soup becomes
thick, and that it sticks to the finger, and that it is
congealed, that done, one puts it to heat, to
de-congeal it, then, one takes the leather out of the
soup, fo press it with the hands, until such
time that the soup is a little outside of [the leather], next
one passes the said soup through a linen cloth, and
one stiffens the cambric with [it], one needs to
maintain always the temperature, in order that the
cambric, and the glue do not congeal
in the hands at all, one needs to plunge only two
or three pieces at a time, and hang them immediately,
to avoid this inconvenience, the cambric being
dry, if one sees that it is too stiff to
use, before plunging other pieces
of cambric, one needs to pour into the glue
three or four, spoons of water, more or less
according to the quantity of glue that one sees,
but the best is, not to put water in the glue, since the stuffs,
or cambric becomes [too] pliable after . . . 
Note, that one must never pour water,
into fish glue, ~~~~
I misspoke, here above, as you can see; ~~~
