To subtract red [from] cloth
One must make lye. Take cold
vines and burn it to ashes. Take two pots
of rain water and put the ashes and pour the
clear lye off into a new earthenware pot
and take the red cloth and put it in the lye
until it is saturated [lit. overjuiced], and put the pot, well covered
with an earthenware lid in the evening from the fire
in the lukewarm oven and let it process until
the next day at the fire. Then take
the same pot and place it on a cupboard
with fire (?? chafing dish?) and let it cook for an hour. And let it
turn about constantly with a new pot
spoon [so] that it doesn't burn. Then take
after a new earthenware pot and take the first
from the fire and begin to squeeze the cloth out
into the second pot, and once the wetness is out, take
a half pint of white wine vinegar and stir this in
slowly throughout and let it cook on a still
fire and stir it so that it does not burn until a ____.
And then let it sit until it has sunk, and
pour the the uppermost [liquid] off and take the cloth and throw
it on the floor and let [it] dry thus.
