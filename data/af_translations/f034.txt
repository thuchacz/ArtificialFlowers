one does as here before, one does this 
only, for one day, or two, after the parchment
is outside of the pass, because the pieces
of coverlet must be hung in the open air,
when one does not have the convenience of having the
pieces, one takes the whole entire coverlet,
half-worn, better more worn than less; but
when the coverlet is entirely worn, one
folds it in two to make use of it. ~~
In removing the parchment from the pass one
needs to leave it to dry on the board, and
next remove the leaves, ~~~
Another way to dry the velum, after
having washed it, without wanting to print it, one
takes it out of the water, and one lays it flat immediately on
the board, very clean. ~~~
To make green, one needs to take a
quarter [pound] of verdigris; it must be well ~
ground, one puts it in the evening, in a cruet
very clean, next put there a little water, and
mix it like this very well, next put there again a little water
such that the water does not overpower the verdigris
at all, one leaves it to soak thus all
night, the next day, one sprinkles on top
