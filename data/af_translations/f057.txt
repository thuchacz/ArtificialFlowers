to soak a little, after that one needs to make it boil, and
when the dye starts to boil;
being a little boiled, one takes it out
of the dye, and one does as I 
said here before, about brown yellow, jonquil ~~~
Cloth that one dyes yellow like
silk, at the last rinse, after having
pressed the water out well, one can put them in
verjus, if one wants, and if one sees that
the color is more beautiful to one's liking, also
the verjus, one can continue that, each
time that one dyes, but if one sees that the
color is not more beautiful with the verjus, it
is not necessary to use it, because the
cambric is in peril of sticking to itself [of staining itself??], and of
changing color, next one dries
it, being dry, one stiffens it with 
fish glue, and just as well with
hide glue, if it is for making flowers;
being dry, one irons it with the hands
only; if not, one needs to iron it like
silk. ~~~
Cloth that one dyes yellow like silk; being
soaked a half hour, or three quarters of an hour; being well boiled,
and the color to your liking; one needs to press the dye out well,
next one needs to open it up well, and plunge it into the verjus, if
you find it good; then press the verjus out well, and
throw it also into the soapy wash of white soap; being well
washed to your liking, one needs to rinse it in two, or three,
other rain, or fountain, waters, at the last, one
needs to press out the water well; then one hangs it in the attic
with the window closed; being dry; one plunges them,
and stiffens [them] in the hide glue; but one does not need
to press the glue, as strongly as the water; but the cambric etc.
must be a little well wet; as I said here before,
then one hangs it again once more in the attic, with the
window closed, all as one did with all the other
colors; being dry; if it is for making flowers, one 
needs to polish it with the hands only; then fold
them, and put them in a paper; one needs to do
like that also, with all the colors that you make,
for making flowers; B when it is not for making
flowers with, one needs always to iron it all with
an iron as one irons linens; ~
Red cloth, and violet, is made as
red silk, and violet, but instead of
vinegar, one can take rain water
