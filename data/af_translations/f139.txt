a table [and] begin to paint. But one must lay a bad [cloth]
or something that cannot be injured underneath, and hang every
sheet from a little cord all over. But then let a 
pack of little cords dry and continue thus
until that is red enough, according to your taste, all over
up to six or seven times. [If] you want to have it
shiny, go over it with egg white, finely
beaten. This soup is also good to make silk red,
especially a white ground or yellow. But [it] must first be
washed clean af linten[?bits of the brazilwood?]. But one must cook
herein a little bit. It is also good for making withe wood red.
And once it is red enough, paint it with [egg] wash. It shines
and is like mahogany. The ground of this can serve more
than once. With other water and a bit more wood
therein and alum, [it] is a good sap again.
But the size of the alum [needed for] such a double
bucket one surely learns oneself.
