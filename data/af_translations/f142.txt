Way to dye paper red
Put an ounce of potash in
an earthenware pot, then boil
a stoop of rainwater and
pour it, all boiling, on the
potash, let it stand
untouched until the next day. Then
gently, without stirring, pour the clear
lye out into another 
clean pot. Then take a kanne
of this lye, set it to boil
and take a pound of red cloth
put this in a clean pot and once
the lye has boiled, pour it on the
cloth, let it somewhat trecken
on the fire, turning the cloth
from time to time. Once it is all well
drunken through, take remove it [from the fire]
and let it stand to cool some
then put the other kanne of lye
on the fire. Let it boil. Then squeeze out
the cloth as tightly as you
can, and while the lye boils, put
the cloth in it. Turn 
and stir it well. Let [it] boil for a quarter
of an hour. Then let it cool
a bit. Squeeze it out again.
Then, add all the soup and
place this on the fire. Put
a susijn of white alum in it.
Let this boil a bit. The foam
must not be thrown
away since good dye can
come from it. Then put a bit of
white tartar in a pot
and pour the boiling dye on top of it.
If you see that there is still foam
forming, take it off, and and
do not put it with the other foam. Then
let it sit for two or three days
without stirring. Then gently pour
all the dye off, and see if the
sediment is dirty or if there are black
bits in it. If there are any in it, then
it isn’t good. If the sediment is clean,
put it in with the dye. Then place
it again on the fire. If it is
purple, it is that there is not enough
tartar in it. Also, if there is
too much tartar in it, it is
too pale. Then put some starch
dust-bloom?? in a pot, crush
