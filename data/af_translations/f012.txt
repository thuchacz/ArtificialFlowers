For making more pansy; for making alimon,
and ranunculus; one needs to take, three mussel shells
full of mien rouge [my red? Same red?], one needs to rub it well
with a piece of marble, on top of some marble or some gres [sandstone?];
being well rubbed; one needs to throw it in a glass, or the 
third part of a glass, of the hide glue, with a 
mussel shell full of vermillion, one needs to 
stir it well, and to mix it together; next on needs to throw
the white cambric into the glue, and turn it well, and
press it well, and return it in the hands, rubbing it a 
little, in order that the dye will be well penetrated, and that
the cambric, muslin; and toile will be a good red;
after that, one needs to squeeze the glue, and dye
within, so well that it stays reasonably well wetted,
then one needs to hang in the attic; and being dry,
the toile, cambric, and muslin; being cut into
leaves, one needs to put a clear carmine on it; that 
you see to be a very beautiful color to your liking;
