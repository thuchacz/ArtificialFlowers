well as jonquil colors, and yellow, dyed
with baker's chamomile. ~~~
But jonquil cambric, and yellow dyed
with gamboge do not undye, but
when it is spoiled, or just as well not beautiful
enough to use, one can dye it
red, with vermillion, and fish
glue, or with hide glue.
return here above to the 3. folio, at the beginning.
Blue dyed with brown, and
pale starch blue, cambric is undyed
with very hot water, the amount of a
pint, one needs to change it in three or
four hot waters, and one rinses it one
time in cold water, next one pours
all the water together stirring them ~
vigorously while pouring, in order that the blue will be ~
all amassed in one water, next one ~
leaves this water one hour, or two, without
moving it, in order that the blue is all fallen ~
to the bottom, then one pours the water all
gently taking care to [not] move the bottom, but
at the end, when one sees that the blue
comes with the water, before throwing it all away
