Way to make ashes from grapevine tendrils
One can these, by a pure heart, without mixing
other ashes in, that are newly burnt, one puts it on the fire and the ashes
all together in a bad/old earthenware pot, which one from time
to time pokes, until it is all consumed.
To make lye from grapevine-tendril ash
Take three handfuls of ashes [scooped] with two hands, and 7 or 8
pints of rain or fountain water, let this cook until [it reduces to] 4 or 5
pints, should be cooked in a clean [metal] marmite. Once it is
removed from the fire, it must be cast [i.e., levigated] into a metal pot that
has not been used for any other thing, such as dyeing red,
leaving the ashes, so much as possible, on the bottom of the
marmite. The next day, one pours the ashes through a cloth
into another pot, still careful not to move [what is on]
the bottom. The lye is then good to use to dye a pink color,
as follows here.
Take a quarter or half pound of safflower, put it in a little
white linen bag, securely tied, place it to soak
in rain or fountain water. One washes(?) the safflower a little
itself, changing the water two times, and then letting [it] soak
from five-thirty in the evening until five-thirty in the morning.
And then is it washed, and from time to time, its
water is changed until it is clear. The bag should not
be wrung out but removed from the water with the hands, except for
the last time: then, the little bag must be very firmly wrung out,
as much as is possible.
