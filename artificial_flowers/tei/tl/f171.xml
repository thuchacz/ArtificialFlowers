<lb/>After, one pulls the safflower out of the bag and puts it
<lb/>in a large, flat[-bottomed] pot, and once everything is thoroughly picked
<lb/>[out of the bag], one sprinkles there a little rain or fountain water
<lb/>over [it]. Then one pours into the safflower a pint of lye made
<lb/>from the ashes of grapevine tendrils. Then is the pot covered
<lb/>with another of the same size, so that it
<lb/>can catch the air. Set it in a dark place,
<lb/>set a covering-cloth over it, and let it proceed
<lb/>for 2 hours, and [it] must then be bruised for 15 minutes.
<lb/>One must remove it by handfuls. Once one can
<lb/>take no more [out], pour the rest into the bag again, [and] this
<lb/>is wrung out into a clean pot. One prepares immediately
<lb/>another pot with some white wine vinegar, in which the fabric
<lb/>is made wet. Being well drunk, one takes these [i.e., the vinegar-soaked fabric and the lyed petals]
<lb/>all together, gives them into the hands of the person that
<lb/>bruised and and wrung out the safflower, which entire mass alike had
<lb/>been set in the dye. Wash these same [things] well one by one.
<lb/>Proceed with a light hand as quickly as is possible.
<lb/>The fabric, having her color, is washed again, piece by
<lb/>piece, after having removed [un-dunked] it well. Put them in verjuice
<lb/>after [they] are squeezed out as before. [They] are rinsed in three or 4
<lb/>pots following before prepared with 2 or 3 pints of clean
<lb/>rain or fountain water, where after one washes a few pieces of fabric
<lb/>therein [once] the first color is rinsed in, which serves
<lb/>as a pale color and is then dried together in the attic. [is there a little flower at the end?]
