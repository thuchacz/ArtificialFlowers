<lb/>Way for melting silk gum, or other-
<lb/>wise said tragacanth gum;
<lb/>One takes for this one patar of the said gum; it
<lb/>is necessary to put it to soak, in a half pint
<lb/>of rainwater, better more than less. One needs to
<lb/>leave it like that for two days, then one needs to take
<lb/>a spoon and stir it well, and hit it with it
<lb/>until such time it becomes a clear glue-pap, and if
<lb/>one sees that the soup is too thick, one needs
<lb/>to pour in a bit of water, until such time that it
<lb/>is good; then one needs to make it boil, a
<lb/>bit, and that while stirring it still. After that,
<lb/>one needs to pass it through a cloth, and after that,
<lb/>use it to starch silk with it.
<lb/>Way to make silk flowers
<lb/>Note: when the silk is very well peniez, put it on top
<lb/>of glass, very flat, the size of one window pane,
<lb/>reasonably big enough. Next, one needs to take the flat side of a knife,
<lb/>and take the silk gum with it. Next, one needs to spread it on top
<lb/>of the silk with it, and that also for a long time, that the silk becomes very well
<lb/>moistened, and fatty. After that, one needs to turn it over, and
<lb/>one needs to do the same. After that, one needs to put it on top of a
<lb/>towel, to let it dry in the wind, and or otherwise also.
<lb/>Next one needs to apply it, and put it on top of the form; and 
<lb/>go over it with a pierre liquoire. And dry it near to
<lb/>the fire, and or else above a stove. Next, remove it
<lb/>from there. And then cut flowers from it, of all kinds
<lb/>that you want to make. But one needs always to keep
<lb/>silk prepared for making flowers between white paper.
<lb/>The same also for silk that is not yet prepared for making flowers.
