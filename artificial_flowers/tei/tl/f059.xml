<lb/>another terrine, when the glue ~
<lb/>becomes congealed, one needs always to uncongeal it
<lb/>over a chafing dish, before stiffening the
<lb/>cambric with [it], one needs to do the same
<lb/>also, with hide glue, ~~
<lb/>Way for making hide ~
<lb/>glue, one needs to take a half pound
<lb/>of white leather, as one cuts lanyards,
<lb/>the little pieces which fall from it
<lb/>only, ) when one goes to buy it, one
<lb/>needs to always explain, that it is for ~
<lb/>making hide glue with, and
<lb/>qu'but one needs to avoid taking the ~
<lb/>little pieces of red leather, or just as well yellow,
<lb/>or blue, because that spoils the glue, to stiffen
<lb/>cambric for making flowers; one needs
<lb/>to wash the leather, as clean as one can,
<lb/>next one needs to take it out of the water,
<lb/>and press the water out, next one takes two + + or three
<lb/>pints of water + + rather more than less + in an earthenware pot, from there
<lb/>one puts the leather immediately in the said water,
<lb/>next one + + puts it on a chafing dish + + or foot stove
