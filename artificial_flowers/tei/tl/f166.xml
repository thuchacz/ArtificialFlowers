<lb/>of our verdigris,
<lb/>a half pound of white wax,
<lb/>and three quarters of other
<lb/>a half pound, and a half
<lb/>quarter a rinschen hast [that you have rinsed?];
<lb/>all of it well melted and stir [it] together without
<lb/>boi boiling. Next [one] needs to plunge the
<lb/>paper inside [with] a bande [i.e. length of fabric] at the same time
<lb/>the width of three taille [regular size?], roughly,
<lb/>but the same length as the the paper is
<lb/>in its length.
<lb/>This is for the confectioner
<lb/>who make desserts, and because
<lb/>you want to make [it] with [it].
<lb/>But if you see that the paper
<lb/>is not as green as you wish,
<lb/>into this you need to put more
<lb/>of the green of Spain, or otherwise said,
<lb/>verdegris.
