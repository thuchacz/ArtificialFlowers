<lb/>that with a light hand, as quickly as one
<lb/>can, until such time as the cambric is very
<lb/>red, and well penetrated in the dye, then
<lb/>one washes it piece, by piece, a little, and one ~
<lb/>presses it with the hand, as hard as one can, ~
<lb/>then one throws it in the verjus piece, by piece, one needs to 
<lb/>work it well, and plunge, then one needs to press the verjus outside. ~~
<lb/>Next one throws them in a terrine, prepared 
<lb/>with three pints of water, to rinse them, one piece
<lb/>at a time, one needs to work it well, but without
<lb/>rubbing, in any way, from there one takes it from
<lb/>this water, one needs to + a little press + the water outside, and one throws it
<lb/>in four, or three, other terrines in succession,
<lb/>prepared with two pints of water, in each
<lb/>terrine, ✠ when one is at the final water, one
<lb/>needs to press the water very hard out of the cambric, ~
<lb/> next one puts it, and plunges in a half
<lb/>pint of verjus, more, or less, hauling it up
<lb/>so that one can see, the quantity of cambric, in
<lb/>pulling the cambric, piece, by piece, out of the verjus
<lb/>~ one presses it in the hand, not quite as strongly
<lb/>~ as before, next on puts it in a
<lb/>very clean terrine, and very dry, waiting
<lb/>for all the other pale colors to be
<lb/>dyed, to hang them, all together in
<lb/>the attic, with the windows closed, likewise all the other
<lb/>yellowish colors, etc.,
<lb/>This done, one washes again one piece ~
<lb/>of cambric, in the soup wetting it ~
<lb/>in the vinegar also, if there is any left, 
<lb/>✠but without pressing the water outside, except at the 
<lb/>last rinse;~
