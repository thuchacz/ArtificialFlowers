<lb/>half a glass of fish glue, then
<lb/>mix well and break the starch white into the glue. Next one
<lb/>needs to put the starch brown-blue in it, and mix it well. Then plunge
<lb/>the cambric immediately into the soup, until the soup becomes completely penetrated
<lb/>into the cambric but very well wet. One needs to open it well, and press, and
<lb/>turn it over, and rub it a bit, many times, so that the white becomes well
<lb/>penetrated into the cambric. From there, attach it to a cord with pins.~~
<lb/>but if the cord is made of horse hair, it is enough to
<lb/>hang it, taking care that the end from which it hangs
<lb/>does not attach itself together. This command must be
<lb/>observed for all other colors.
<lb/>To make yellowish cloths for 
<lb/>jasmine and other flowers, one needs to put
<lb/>with this starch white and fish glue
<lb/>three or four drops of gamboge
<lb/>To make some reddish ones
<lb/>One needs
<lb/>to take starch white, fish glue,
<lb/>and three or four drops of carmine. This
<lb/>kind of cambric is used to make carnations
<lb/>and other flowers
<lb/>Cloths of this sort can be green
<lb/>One makes them
<lb/>as above, by pouring a few drops from
<lb/>the bottle in which there is green. And if
<lb/>you want to have yellowish color, you put throughout
<lb/>the glue and the green one drop or two of
<lb/>gamboge.
<lb/>Blue cambric is made with starch brown-blue
