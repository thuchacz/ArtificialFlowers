<lb/>way also, as one dyes red silk,
<lb/>but instead of brazil wood,
<lb/>one takes logwood~~
<lb/>Note, that beer, cannot be too old, when it is twelve, and
<lb/>20. years old; and it is much better, than vinegar, and rain water;~
<lb/>Way for jonquil silk, and cloth,
<lb/>one needs to take a half quarter [of a pound]
<lb/>of baker's chamomile + + and for three liards of pounded alum that one makes boil
<lb/>with two pints of rain water; one puts
<lb/>the silk to soak + + in the dye round-about a half quarter
<lb/>of an hour, next one makes it boil together,
<lb/>being a little boiled; one takes the
<lb/>silk, or cloth out of the dye; + + for seeing if it is good one
<lb/>presses it with the hands, and one throws it into
<lb/>a soapy wash of white soap + if it is good; in-following one
<lb/>washes it, as clear, as one sees to be enough,
<lb/>then one needs to rinse it with rain
<lb/>water, and press the water out well, from there one
<lb/>needs to + + make it dry, and after that stiffen it, with silk gum, well
<lb/>soaked, and strongly thick, next one applies it
<lb/>on a board, as evenly as one can,
<lb/>one on top of the other, from there one hangs it on a cord,
<lb/>being dry, one irons it as one
<lb/>does linens., ∞ Note, for making flowers
<lb/>of cambric, one needs
<lb/>never to iron anything, with the iron;
<lb/>Way for having a paler yellow,
<lb/>it suffices to put the silk, in the dye
