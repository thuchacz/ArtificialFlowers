<lb/>Vermillion is mixed, with clear
<lb/>gum, being well mixed, one pours on top a
<lb/>little bit of water, and some drops of gum ~
<lb/>then on leaves it, two, or three hours, like that,
<lb/>next one paints, with the paintbrush, on paper,
<lb/>but when the vermillion becomes too thick, one needs
<lb/>always to thin it with a little water, and some ~
<lb/>clear gum. ~~~
<lb/>Carmine is mixed, as I have said here before,
<lb/>on the fourth folio, at the beginning of this
<lb/>book, at this mark * one returns the folio,
<lb/>and one sees the way, to mix the blue that
<lb/>one calls the ashes of England, this dye is used,
<lb/>for painting blue flowers, and violet also,
<lb/>for that, it is sufficient to pass the red paintbrush, over the blue flower
<lb/>For accommodating the green, for painting leaves
<lb/>and stems of flowers on paper, or parchment,
<lb/>one takes some prepared verdigris, the
<lb/>amount of one half ounce, more, or less, 
<lb/>hauling it up  such that  one wants much, or less to trace, one
<lb/>puts it to soak in a little, pot, with a
<lb/>little vinegar, it suffices when the vinegar,
<lb/>is a little on top of the green, next one ~
<lb/>leaves it to soak for one day, and one night, from there
<lb/>one uses it with the paintbrush, plunging it
<lb/>each time, a little in the thickness of the dye,
<lb/>when the dye becomes too thick, one needs there
