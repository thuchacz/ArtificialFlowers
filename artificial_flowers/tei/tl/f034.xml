<lb/>applies the flowers from the garden on top, and
<lb/>one does as here before, one does this 
<lb/>only, for one day, or two, after the parchment
<lb/>is outside of the pass, because the pieces
<lb/>of coverlet must be hung in the open air,
<lb/>when one does not have the convenience of having the
<lb/>pieces, one takes the whole entire coverlet,
<lb/>half-worn, better more worn than less; but
<lb/>when the coverlet is entirely worn, one
<lb/>folds it in two to make use of it. ~~
<lb/>In removing the parchment from the pass one
<lb/>needs to leave it to dry on the board, and
<lb/>next remove the leaves, ~~~
<lb/>Another way to dry the velum, after
<lb/>having washed it, without wanting to print it, one
<lb/>takes it out of the water, and one lays it flat immediately on
<lb/>the board, very clean. ~~~
<lb/>To make green, one needs to take a
<lb/>quarter [pound] of verdigris; it must be well ~
<lb/>ground, one puts it in the evening, in a cruet
<lb/>very clean, next put there a little water, and
<lb/>mix it like this very well, next put there again a little water
<lb/>such that the water does not overpower the verdigris
<lb/>at all, one leaves it to soak thus all
<lb/>night, the next day, one sprinkles on top
