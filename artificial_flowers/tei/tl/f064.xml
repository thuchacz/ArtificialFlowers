<lb/>well as jonquil colors, and yellow, dyed
<lb/>with baker's chamomile. ~~~
<lb/>But jonquil cambric, and yellow dyed
<lb/>with gamboge do not undye, but
<lb/>when it is spoiled, or just as well not beautiful
<lb/>enough to use, one can dye it
<lb/>red, with vermillion, and fish
<lb/>glue, or with hide glue.
<lb/>return here above to the 3. folio, at the beginning.
<lb/>Blue dyed with brown, and
<lb/>pale starch blue, cambric is undyed
<lb/>with very hot water, the amount of a
<lb/>pint, one needs to change it in three or
<lb/>four hot waters, and one rinses it one
<lb/>time in cold water, next one pours
<lb/>all the water together stirring them ~
<lb/>vigorously while pouring, in order that the blue will be ~
<lb/>all amassed in one water, next one ~
<lb/>leaves this water one hour, or two, without
<lb/>moving it, in order that the blue is all fallen ~
<lb/>to the bottom, then one pours the water all
<lb/>gently taking care to [not] move the bottom, but
<lb/>at the end, when one sees that the blue
<lb/>comes with the water, before throwing it all away
