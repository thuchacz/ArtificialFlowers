<lb/>Way to make ashes from grapevine tendrils
<lb/>One can these, by a pure heart, without mixing
<lb/>other ashes in, that are newly burnt, one puts it on the fire and the ashes
<lb/>all together in a bad/old earthenware pot, which one from time
<lb/>to time pokes, until it is all consumed.
<lb/>To make lye from grapevine-tendril ash
<lb/>Take three handfuls of ashes [scooped] with two hands, and 7 or 8
<lb/>pints of rain or fountain water, let this cook until [it reduces to] 4 or 5
<lb/>pints, should be cooked in a clean [metal] marmite. Once it is
<lb/>removed from the fire, it must be cast [i.e., levigated] into a metal pot that
<lb/>has not been used for any other thing, such as dyeing red,
<lb/>leaving the ashes, so much as possible, on the bottom of the
<lb/>marmite. The next day, one pours the ashes through a cloth
<lb/>into another pot, still careful not to move [what is on]
<lb/>the bottom. The lye is then good to use to dye a pink color,
<lb/>as follows here.
<lb/>Take a quarter or half pound of safflower, put it in a little
<lb/>white linen bag, securely tied, place it to soak
<lb/>in rain or fountain water. One washes(?) the safflower a little
<lb/>itself, changing the water two times, and then letting [it] soak
<lb/>from five-thirty in the evening until five-thirty in the morning.
<lb/>And then is it washed, and from time to time, its
<lb/>water is changed until it is clear. The bag should not
<lb/>be wrung out but removed from the water with the hands, except for
<lb/>the last time: then, the little bag must be very firmly wrung out,
<lb/>as much as is possible.
