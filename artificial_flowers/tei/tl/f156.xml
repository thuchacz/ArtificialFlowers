<lb/>To dye paper yellow
<lb/>One takes a sisein [=coinage type] of saffron, which one lets extract in the quantity
<lb/>of a pint of water. Once it is reasonably well extracted, one pours it off
<lb/>and puts some more water over the saffron to further extract it. One
<lb/>must also have an ounce of gum, which must be soaked for a few days 
<lb/>ahead of time and poured into the extracted saffron once it is cold.
<lb/>[THU: note the “once it is cold” at the end, which is the only clue that the extraction of the saffron takes place with heat]
