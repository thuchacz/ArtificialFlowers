<lb/>Way to gild with gold or silver
<lb/>The only thing that one wants to burnish is gold
<lb/>or silver. One must first prepare the ground
<lb/>with strong glue. Being dry, lay next
<lb/>a layer of lime with white ceruse, paying attention
<lb/>continually that you do not ever lay a second layer
<lb/>unless the first is entirely dry. And do not
<lb/>leave it ever to dry where it is very
<lb/>sunny. And do not lay the white too thickly. One
<lb/>must lay it 9 or 10 times. Then refine [it]
<lb/>and make it very even with a 
<lb/>wolf’s tooth or with water from Spanish
<lb/>soap, and scour it with it until it
<lb/>is even. Next, one must leave it to rest
<lb/>at least one day. Before you go to gild or
<lb/>silver it, only under the gild [areas] one puts
<lb/>the two last coats of glue, some white
<lb/>ceruse, and orange paint, on the ground
<lb/>to have gold color. ~~~~
<lb/>Bile of an eel melted in some brandy
<lb/>is good for illuminating gold or silver
<lb/>in the following colors: green, black, grey,
<lb/>and yellow.
<lb/>It does so that the paint flows, and makes that
<lb/>it does not flake off. This small quantity of
<lb/>gall from an eel is but only for drawing
<lb/>with a paintbrush on little images, but as we make
