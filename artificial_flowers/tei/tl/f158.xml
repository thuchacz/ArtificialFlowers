<lb/>To make green paper
<lb/>Take the greens of celery, the youngest of all the ribs,
<lb/>removed and pounded in a mortar, then
<lb/>wrung out, and then pounded again, three times.
<lb/>Then take verdigris and boil it in the soup
<lb/>until it is melted. Put in as much as
<lb/>you want to have green. The more green, the
<lb/>higher [=more intense] the color. Also, a bit of tartar. From time
<lb/>to time, stir until the whole thing is melted. Then take
<lb/>the paper and lay it on a table or board. Then take
<lb/>a little painter’s knife and stroke it thereover.
<lb/>Then the one side being done, leave it to dry,
<lb/>and being well dry, then do the other side, and
<lb/>that so many times until it is green enough.
<lb/>After that, according to taste, take then egg white,
<lb/>stroke it thereover to give a glare once
<lb/>it is very dry.
