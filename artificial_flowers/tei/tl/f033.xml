<lb/>After the parchment, is scraped one
<lb/>throws them into water immediately, next being well
<lb/>washed, and eight days have passed, if the water remains
<lb/>clear it is a sign that it is washed enough. ~~
<lb/>Next one takes it outside of the water, pressing it
<lb/>in the hand as much as one can, and one
<lb/>spreads it, well polished, on top of a piece of 
<lb/>coverlet; and one applies immediately on ~
<lb/>leaves from the garden, with the underside on top of the
<lb/>velum; this being done, one puts there a board on top
<lb/>of the same size as a board
<lb/>suitable for this work, next one puts there again
<lb/>another piece of coverlet on the said
<lb/>board, then some parchment, and some leaves,
<lb/>all as the first board, one continues this
<lb/>five, or six, boards one on the other, if
<lb/>one wants it, but at the last board one puts there
<lb/>on top very heavy weights, [for] the time of
<lb/>seven or eight days, ~~~
<lb/>Note when the parchment is removed from the
<lb/>pass, and it is not well printed
<lb/>everywhere, one wets with a piece of sponge
<lb/>the place that is not well printed, as
<lb/>closely as one can, but one needs to take care that
<lb/>the water does not run on the velum, next one
