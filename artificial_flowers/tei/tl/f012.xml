<lb/>For making more pansy; for making alimon,
<lb/>and ranunculus; one needs to take, three mussel shells
<lb/>full of mien rouge [my red? Same red?], one needs to rub it well
<lb/>with a piece of marble, on top of some marble or some gres [sandstone?];
<lb/>being well rubbed; one needs to throw it in a glass, or the 
<lb/>third part of a glass, of the hide glue, with a 
<lb/>mussel shell full of vermillion, one needs to 
<lb/>stir it well, and to mix it together; next on needs to throw
<lb/>the white cambric into the glue, and turn it well, and
<lb/>press it well, and return it in the hands, rubbing it a 
<lb/>little, in order that the dye will be well penetrated, and that
<lb/>the cambric, muslin; and toile will be a good red;
<lb/>after that, one needs to squeeze the glue, and dye
<lb/>within, so well that it stays reasonably well wetted,
<lb/>then one needs to hang in the attic; and being dry,
<lb/>the toile, cambric, and muslin; being cut into
<lb/>leaves, one needs to put a clear carmine on it; that 
<lb/>you see to be a very beautiful color to your liking;
