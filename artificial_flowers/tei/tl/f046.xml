<lb/>Note when you don't want to buy the green
<lb/>at the painter's; ~ ✠ ✠ ✠ .. to this line, read
<lb/>Behold the way that one needs to prepare it;
<lb/>one needs to take a half quarter [of a pound]; or an ounce,
<lb/>of verdigris, it must be well pounded, then
<lb/>pass it through a thick little sieve; then one needs to rub it,
<lb/>with some clear gum, and a few drops of vinegar;
<lb/>on top of a marble slab, or of sandstone; being rubbed
<lb/>enough; one needs to put it in a little pot, and thin
<lb/>it with some vinegar; and from time, to time, stretch it
<lb/>always like that; putting in some times some
<lb/>drops of gum, without ever putting water in it;
<lb/>because vinegar is the best
<lb/>after that you use it with the paintbrush, for tracing
<lb/>on paper, etc. ~~~
<lb/>But when you want to have the green a little more
<lb/>brown, one needs to put there a little more of the gum; ~
