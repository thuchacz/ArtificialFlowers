<lb/>Note at this mark ) the little pieces that fall from shoes,
<lb/>white, and from the white linings of shoes; all these little pieces
<lb/>there, are very good for that also; but one needs to put the leather to soak
<lb/>for one day; before washing it; Note when the glue is made, and that
<lb/>the leather is pressed a little out of the glue; you can the leather
<lb/>once more into the same earthenware pot, with three [illeg.] ∞
<lb/>[illeg.] ~o~ pints of water; rather [illeg.]less, than [illeg.]more; one needs to let it draw [itself out]; 
<lb/>all like the first glue; one needs to put it over the fire; but
<lb/>without ever boiling, from the morning, all the way until the next
<lb/>morning; one needs do the same also, with the first glue =
