<lb/>after that; one needs to pass it through a linen cloth also, and
<lb/>mix it with the first glue; next one needs to stiffen, and
<lb/>make colors with [it], as you wish to do; But
<lb/>before passing either one through the linen cloth, one needs to leave it
<lb/>to cool, to see if it is congealed enough, such that one could
<lb/>cut it with a knife; if that is not [the case], one needs to again
<lb/>leave it to draw [itself out] over the fire; all until such time that it is good; but the 2.nd 
<lb/>glue is not ordinarily as strong, as the first, that is why,
<lb/>one needs to mix them together; But when you have need of a greater
<lb/>quantity, instead of a half pound; one needs to take a pound of leather,
<lb/>and more still if there is need; and one needs to take water by hauling it out;
<lb/>one needs to do the same, with fish glue also; ~
