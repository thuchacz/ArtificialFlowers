<lb/>Note, red paper, is made again,
<lb/>in this way; one takes a packet of
<lb/>vermillion, or the amount of a mussel
<lb/>shell,; with two mussel shells, of
<lb/>minium, this is a coarse red dyestuff;
<lb/>that is why, one needs to rub it well
<lb/>on the marble; before mixing it
<lb/>with the vermillion; after that one needs to take
<lb/>clear gum, and vermillion, and 
<lb/>minium, being mixed together in a dish, one
<lb/>needs to pour a little of this clear gum
<lb/>on top, and one mixes well together the two
<lb/>dyes with a little stick, the dye being
<lb/>well mixed; one needs to pour in the dye a
<lb/>half glass of water, one needs to stir it all well
<lb/>together; and after one needs to take a =
<lb/>note without gum, water only [suffices] for 
<lb/>making paper
