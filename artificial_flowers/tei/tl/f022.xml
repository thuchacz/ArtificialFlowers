<lb/>✠
<lb/>Note, before pouring the safflower into 
<lb/>the little sack, in order to wring it more easily,
<lb/>one needs to take in one hand a
<lb/>handful of safflower; and press it like that
<lb/>in the soup; next, being very well pressed,
<lb/>all of the soup [being] outside, one needs to continue like
<lb/>that, all until the time, that all of the safflower is
<lb/>pressed; next one needs to pour it immediately into 
<lb/>into the little sack, and press well all of
<lb/>the soup outside; next you make use of it immediately;
<lb/>Note, if you have a little too much lye, a
<lb/>pint and a half, more or less, according to the quantity
<lb/>of safflower; you can pour on the safflower
