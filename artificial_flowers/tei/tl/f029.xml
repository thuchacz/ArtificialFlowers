<lb/>succession, to the last, one needs to 
<lb/>press the water outside well, from there one puts it in
<lb/>the verjus; next one takes again 
<lb/>another piece, and one does as the first,
<lb/>and one continues it [with] the other pieces of cambric ~
<lb/>Like that, until the time that the rinse, 
<lb/>gives no more colors, as appropriate and ~
<lb/>when one removes the cambric out of the verjus, one
<lb/>does not need to strongly press it in the hand;
<lb/>Note the last [point on] verjus: shortly after, [it] spoils the
<lb/>colors, this is why it is effaced [above]:
<lb/>Note, that all of the earthenware pots, must be 
<lb/>new, and very clean, next take
<lb/>care about this ,.~~~
<lb/>Note✠ ✠
<lb/>The cambric being quite dry, one plunges it
<lb/>into the fish glue. One needs not to
<lb/>take more glue than that the first
<lb/>colors should be well moistened; one does the same
<lb/>with pale colors as well. The cambric being
<lb/>quite dry, one polishes them with the hand, from
<lb/>both sides, and one folds them, each color inside
<lb/>a white paper. And when one wants to use
<lb/>them, one takes only one or two pieces of them at
<lb/>a time. ~~~~ Note: as I said before this,
<lb/>that the cords must be of
<lb/>horsehair in order to not attach, with the pins the cambrics
<lb/>to the cord.
<lb/>Note, the most favourable weather, for ~
<lb/>dyeing pink, and like [this] too ~
<lb/>all the other colors, even also for washing
