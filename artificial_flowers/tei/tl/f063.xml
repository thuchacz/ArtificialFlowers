<lb/>with lye made from vine ash,
<lb/>the lye must be strongly clear,

<lb/>makes it boil, until such time as the cambric
<lb/>is well white, next one takes it from the fire
<lb/>all boiling, immediately one takes a stick,
<lb/>and one removes the cambric, one needs to throw them ~
<lb/>immediately into a bucket of rain or fountain water,
<lb/>being rinsed, one throws it again
<lb/>into another bucket of water, from there one ~
<lb/>puts it to whiten one day, and one night, next
<lb/>one rinses it, lightly with the hand without rubbing,
<lb/>the other rinses must be made in the same
<lb/>way also, next one needs to dry it,
<lb/>and when one makes the lye one ~
<lb/>needs to tie it up it a little, and put it
<lb/>to boil, and whiten, with the fine linens, being
<lb/>dry, this cambric can be used for dyeing
<lb/>all sorts of colors, but for dyeing
<lb/>pink one needs to always choose the
<lb/>whitest cambric that one has,
<lb/>Blue color, dyed with moss/lichen?, is
<lb/>undyed in the same way also, as
