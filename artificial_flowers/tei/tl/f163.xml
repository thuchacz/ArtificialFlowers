<lb/>Come, for you must clean it off.
<lb/>You should take the paper
<lb/>but do not hang it
<lb/>to dry, rather lay it
<lb/>on leather or sticks, and it
<lb/>must be fully dry. Before you
<lb/>even go over [wipe] it, the weather must
<lb/>be fair to do this.
<lb/>you must go over the right side 6 times
<lb/>and then the other side 3 to 4 times.
<lb/>~~~
<lb/>I should guess put
<lb/>in a quarter of verdigris
<lb/>for the first time, and
<lb/>it must be pounded. and then
<lb/>further add a can of rain
<lb/>water and a bit more than
<lb/>an ounce of tartar, and a
<lb/>half a spoon of pounded alum
