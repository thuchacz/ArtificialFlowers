<lb/>Note, again another way, for the same red;
<lb/>✠ Take for one patard of brazil wood, and for
<lb/>two liards alum, with two pints of old beer, the older,
<lb/>is the best; leave that to boil together, until [reduced by]
<lb/>half; next one passes the soup through a clear
<lb/>linen cloth, and one pours it into a bottle; and when
<lb/>one wants to use it, and paint with it; one pours
<lb/>of this red dye, into a mussel shell, or
<lb/>just as well into an oyster shell, and leave it like that
<lb/>5. or 6. hours. and if you can put it several
<lb/>hours in the sun, the dye will be ready sooner to 
<lb/>use, provided that the sun is not too ardent;
<lb/>for the dye would be in little time, too diminished, and
<lb/>dry in the shell; after that, one needs to pour off the clear [liquid] into
<lb/>another shell very clean also, and some hours later,
<lb/>again pour it into another shell; one needs to continue
<lb/>like this, two or three times, if there is need; for when the
<lb/>dye becomes a little thick, this marks [the point that] it is good for tracing
<lb/>on cambric, and on paper; you can test with the
<lb/>paintbrush if the color is good, for your use; Note,
<lb/>In the same way also one readies, or prepares the color
<lb/>violet; but instead of brazil wood; one needs to take some
<lb/>logwood; Note that one needs for it to be good beer, without
<lb/>being mixed, when it will be ten. and 20. years old) One makes
<lb/>red paper of this also, with the two reds, and some violet also ~~
