<lb/>To subtract red [from] cloth
<lb/>One must make lye. Take cold
<lb/>vines and burn it to ashes. Take two pots
<lb/>of rain water and put the ashes and pour the
<lb/>clear lye off into a new earthenware pot
<lb/>and take the red cloth and put it in the lye
<lb/>until it is saturated [lit. overjuiced], and put the pot, well covered
<lb/>with an earthenware lid in the evening from the fire
<lb/>in the lukewarm oven and let it process until
<lb/>the next day at the fire. Then take
<lb/>the same pot and place it on a cupboard
<lb/>with fire (?? chafing dish?) and let it cook for an hour. And let it
<lb/>turn about constantly with a new pot
<lb/>spoon [so] that it doesn't burn. Then take
<lb/>after a new earthenware pot and take the first
<lb/>from the fire and begin to squeeze the cloth out
<lb/>into the second pot, and once the wetness is out, take
<lb/>a half pint of white wine vinegar and stir this in
<lb/>slowly throughout and let it cook on a still
<lb/>fire and stir it so that it does not burn until a ____.
<lb/>And then let it sit until it has sunk, and
<lb/>pour the the uppermost [liquid] off and take the cloth and throw
<lb/>it on the floor and let [it] dry thus.
