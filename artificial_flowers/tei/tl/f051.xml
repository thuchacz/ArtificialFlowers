<lb/>silk gum, being well gummed,
<lb/>one applies it on a board, one [has] the
<lb/>task of polishing it also as evenly as one
<lb/>can, next one hangs it on cords, being
<lb/>quasi dry, one irons it with an
<lb/>iron as one irons the linens. ~~
<lb/>Note, if one does not want, to have the ~
<lb/>silk so red brown, instead of vinegar
<lb/>one needs to make the dye boil with
<lb/>some rain water, + + but two pints of old beer is better still; the silk being well~
<lb/>boiled, one takes it out of the dye, and one
<lb/>hangs it on cord; after that, one can soak it again in the soup;
<lb/>and throws it, bing dry, in the soapy wash, it ~
<lb/>must be cold, without ever warming it,
<lb/>but if all the colors are good, to one's liking, one must not 
<lb/>wash it at all, in any way.... ~~~~~
<lb/>Like [this] also for washing all sorts
<lb/>of taffeta, the water should never be hot,
<lb/>one washes all sorts of colors, as
<lb/>one washes white taffeta, one needs to
<lb/>leave [it] to soak for one day, and one night, being
<lb/>very well soaped, before washing it, then
<lb/>one washes it also as clean as one can,
<lb/>and one does as the white taffeta, but without blue in the
<lb/>silk gum; ~
<lb/>Violet silk, is made in the same
