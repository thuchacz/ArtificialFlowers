<lb/>To make green dye
<lb/>For a half pound of verdigris,
<lb/>take two cans of rain
<lb/>water and add a half a
<lb/>quarter of tartar, and
<lb/>a pan spoon [pennelepel = large copper spoon used in baking] of pounded alum.
<lb/>Preserve it for one night
<lb/>in a copper bucket or pan. It must
<lb/>be foamy, [geschumt = geschuimt] and
<lb/>must boil down by half.
<lb/>take the green juice
<lb/>in it as long as it is blood-warm.
<lb/>[and is]
<lb/>Verdigris is blue by itself.
<lb/>Take the green juice on the 
<lb/>point of a knife, and should you
<lb/>fear that the verdigris on the side
<lb/>of your pan is not green enough,
<lb/>do not do too much to it,
<lb/>but try it on paper until the
<lb/>color is to your liking,
<lb/>and in case you see that
<lb/>the coloring of your paper is a bit
<lb/>too blue, you must
<lb/>put some more put green color in a dish
<lb/>and add some. [illeg.]
