<lb/>little piece of sponge, and redden the paper with [it];
<lb/>one needs to do your [best] possible, in order that the paper
<lb/>becomes beautiful red enough, being reddened two times,
<lb/>on each side; one passes over it also, being
<lb/>dry, with a little piece of sponge the egg
<lb/>white; very lightly, two times on each
<lb/>size; the egg white, must be well beaten, before
<lb/>you use it; and that generally for all
<lb/>the colors, that you make with [it]; ~~
<lb/>Note when you see, that the dye becomes
<lb/>too thick, one needs to pour a little water on top;
<lb/>and do like that from time, to time; if you
<lb/>find it necessary; one needs to do that also
<lb/>with paper made with vermillion alone;
<lb/>Note at this ✠ that which is written in the nine
<lb/>first lines, to make paper red with 
<lb/>vermillion; that is for painting flowers on
<lb/>paper, and that without using egg white; but
<lb/>for making paper red with vermillion alone;
<lb/>one needs to do all as it is [described,] mixed, with minium◆
