<lb/>throw it in the soapy wash of white soap; next one
<lb/>washes it as clear, as one sees to be enough, then one 
<lb/>needs to rinse it, in two rain waters, at the last
<lb/>one needs to press the water out well; from there, dry it; and
<lb/>being dry; one needs to plunge it well, and stiffen it in
<lb/>hide glue; after that one needs to hang it in the attic
<lb/>on a horsehair cord, and that as evenly as you can
<lb/>one needs to take good care that the end, and the rest does not stick
<lb/>together, for when it is dry, you would have to
<lb/>tear it to detach one from the other; one does not need to
<lb/>press the hide glue strongly out of your cambric etc. but 
<lb/>leave it a little well wet; one needs to do the same with all
<lb/>the colors you make with [it]; the same also with fish
<lb/>glue; Note, when you would like to have a more
<lb/>heightened color still, than the jonquil color, instead of leaving it to soak
<lb/>for half an hour; one needs to leave it to soak three quarters of an hour, and one needs
<lb/>to leave it to boil a longer time also; but if this is for making flowers;
<lb/>gamboge, and saffron, is better still; as here above;
