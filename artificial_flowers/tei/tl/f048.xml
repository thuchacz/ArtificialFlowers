<lb/>to pour a little vinegar, and sometimes
<lb/>also a little water, instead of vinegar, but
<lb/>the first time, one needs to always put to soak
<lb/>with the vinegar, and five, or six drops, 
<lb/>of clear gum, one buys the verdigris
<lb/>prepared, at the painter's, saying that the
<lb/>said green, is for painting on paper, such that it
<lb/>does not have to be prepared, with oil; ~
<lb/>✠ ✠ ✠ ..
<lb/>Another way again, to make 
<lb/>red for painting, on paper, one ~
<lb/>takes a quarter [of a pound] of brazil wood, with
<lb/>two pintes of vinegar, and a half quarter
<lb/>[of a pound] of alum, one leaves it to boil like that, until
<lb/>[reduced by] half, next, one passes the soup through a
<lb/>linen cloth, and one pours it, into a bottle,
<lb/>this lasts for three years, well, for your
<lb/>use, ~~~~~~ read to this ✠
<lb/>But when one wants, to paint with the
<lb/>said red, one pours of this red, into a
<lb/>mussel shell, or just as well, into an oyster
<lb/>shell, one needs to put it in the sun
<lb/>for the space of seven, or eight hours, next
<lb/>one pours off the clear [liquid] into another ~
<lb/>shell, very clean also; and the next day
