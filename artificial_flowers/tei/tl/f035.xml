<lb/>∞ one ounce of white tartar, well
<lb/>ground + + and for two liards ground alum next one pours very gently
<lb/>three pints of rain, or fountain, water
<lb/>in pouring the water on top of the green, one needs to 
<lb/>stir well with a little wooden palette knife,
<lb/>with a long handle
<lb/>+ that one makes for this end, from there, one puts it
<lb/>to boil and one continues to stir it, until
<lb/>such time that the green starts to boil, very
<lb/>strongly; one needs to always take care, to not ~
<lb/>trap the vapor of the fumes that escape
<lb/>from the green; because it is venom; one 
<lb/>leaves it to boil + + stirring always until such time as it is reduced
<lb/>roughly by half; next ~
<lb/>one leaves it to cool, then one passes
<lb/>it through a very white cloth; like
<lb/>one does cheese, pouring one needs to
<lb/>take care not to move the bottom, but
<lb/>when the bright green is all poured [out], and 
<lb/>bottled in a bottle, with three or four
<lb/>spoons reserved, more or less
<lb/>that one leaves in the cruet, to stir
<lb/>with the bottom, being well stirred, one 
<lb/>passes it also through the same cloth, in a
<lb/>dish all by itself, this green is useful for greening
<lb/>the stems of flowers.
<lb/>Note, the earthenware cruet,
<lb/>can never be used for another thing, _
<lb/>it is necessary that it be new; and kept for
<lb/>that [use]
