<lb/>a table [and] begin to paint. But one must lay a bad [cloth]
<lb/>or something that cannot be injured underneath, and hang every
<lb/>sheet from a little cord all over. But then let a 
<lb/>pack of little cords dry and continue thus
<lb/>until that is red enough, according to your taste, all over
<lb/>up to six or seven times. [If] you want to have it
<lb/>shiny, go over it with egg white, finely
<lb/>beaten. This soup is also good to make silk red,
<lb/>especially a white ground or yellow. But [it] must first be
<lb/>washed clean af linten[?bits of the brazilwood?]. But one must cook
<lb/>herein a little bit. It is also good for making withe wood red.
<lb/>And once it is red enough, paint it with [egg] wash. It shines
<lb/>and is like mahogany. The ground of this can serve more
<lb/>than once. With other water and a bit more wood
<lb/>therein and alum, [it] is a good sap again.
<lb/>But the size of the alum [needed for] such a double
<lb/>bucket one surely learns oneself.
