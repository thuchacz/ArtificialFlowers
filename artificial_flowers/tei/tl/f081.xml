<lb/>larger work, so must one take larger
<lb/>quantities of gall and brandy.
<lb/>Note: if you only wish to make light work,
<lb/>with 4 or 5 ground [layers] to lay
<lb/>it is already enough. ~~~~
<lb/>Note that eel gall is only 
<lb/>for illuminating but not for
<lb/>drawing with a paintbrush on
<lb/>little images. To that end, brandy
<lb/>works well on its own. Also one or two little
<lb/>drops of rainwater or fountain water, this is the best
<lb/>to put in the shell with gold or silver and therewith to
<lb/>gild with foam[?] gold or silver. The
<lb/>ground must be made slightly wet with 
<lb/>well beaten egg white, but overall well wet.
<lb/>Thereafter, one lays the gold or the silver foam thereupon,
<lb/>fine or rough, one puts it down with a small
<lb/>brockskens sponge, well washed beforehand, [and]
<lb/>thereafter squeezed out in a cloth, and thereafter,
<lb/>gilded with. And if the sponge becomes somewhat
<lb/>too dry, one does as before. ~~
<lb/>Note: if it is with oil, one takes ghebrant[drying?]
<lb/>oil and one makes it wet with this oil, and
<lb/>[lays] silver or gold foam thereupon. And one
<lb/>does with the sponge as before. ~~
